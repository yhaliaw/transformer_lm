shares of ua the parent of united airlines were extremely active all day friday reacting to news and rumors about the proposed N billion buy of the airline by an employee group
wall street ' takeover spec or risk ar had placed unusually large bets that a takeover would succeed and ua stock would rise
at N p ed came the sick news the big board was halt trading in ua pending news
on the exchange floor as soon as ua stopped trading we braced for a panic said one top floor trader
several traders could be seen shaking their heads when the news flashed
for weeks the market had been nervous about takeover after camp corp ' cash crunch spurred concern about the prospects for future highly leverage takeover
and N minutes after the ua trading halt came news that the ua group could n get financing for its bid
at this point the dow was down about N points
the market cr
ar could n dump their ua stock but they rid themselves of nearly every rumor stock they had
for example their selling caused trading halt to be declared in usa group which closed down N N to N N delta air lines which fell N N to N N and philips industries which sank N to N N
these stocks eventually reopened
but as panic spread spec began to sell blue stocks such as philip morris and international business machines to offset their losses

most of the stock selling pressure came from wall street professionals including computer program traders

now at N one of the market ' post reforms took hold as the s N futures contract had plunged N points equivalent to around a N drop in the dow industrial
under an agreement signed by the big board and the chicago mercantile exchange trading was temporarily halted in chicago
after the trading halt in the s N pit in chicago waves of selling continued to hit stocks themselves on the big board and specialists continued to notch prices down
as a result the link between the futures and stock markets ripped apart
without the guide of stock futures the bar of where traders think the overall stock market is headed many traders were afraid to trust stock prices quoted on the big board
the futures halt was even ass by big board floor traders
it screwed things up said one major specialist
this confusion effectively halted one form of program trading stock index ar that closely links the futures and stock markets and has been blamed by some for the market ' big swings
in a stock ar sell program traders buy or sell big baskets of stocks and offset the trade in futures to lock in a price difference
when the airline information came through it cracked every model we had for the marketplace said a managing director at one of the largest program firms
we did n even get a chance to do the programs we wanted to do
but stocks kept falling
the dow industrial were down N points at N p before the futures halt
at N p at the end of the cooling off period the average was down N points
meanwhile during the the s trading halt s futures sell orders began pi up while stocks in new york kept falling sharply
big board chairman john j ph said yesterday the circuit breaker worked well mechanically
i just think it ' non at this point to get into a debate if index ar would have helped or hurt things
under another post system big board president richard grass mr ph was flying to bangkok as the market was falling was talking on an inter hot line to the other exchanges the securities and exchange commission and the federal reserve board
he <unk> out at a high nerve center on the floor of the big board where he could watch updates on prices and pending stock orders
at about N p ed s futures resumed trading and for a brief time the futures and stock markets started to come back in line
buyers stepped in to the futures pit
but the build of s futures sell orders weighed on the market and the link with stocks began to fray again
at about N the s market care to still another limit of N points down and trading was locked again
futures traders say the s was signaling that the dow could fall as much as N points
during this time small investors began ringing their broker wondering whether another crash had begun
at pr securities inc which is trying to cater to small investors some demo broker thought this would be the final confidence
that ' when george l ball chairman of the pr insurance co of america unit took to the internal inter system to declare that the plunge was only mechanical

however jeffrey b lane president of shear lehman hutton inc said that friday ' plunge is going to set back relations with customers because it reinforce the concern of vol
and i think a lot of people will harp on program trading
it ' going to bring the debate right back to the forefront
as the dow average ground to its final N loss friday the s pit stayed locked at its N trading limit
jeffrey ya of program trader <unk> investment group said N s contracts were for sale on the close the equivalent of N million in stock
but there were no buyers
while friday ' de involved mainly professional traders rather than investors it left the market vulnerable to continued selling this morning traders said
stock futures contracts settled at much lower prices than index of the stock market itself
at those levels stocks are set up to be hammered by index ar who lock in profits by buying futures when futures prices fall and simultaneously sell off stocks
but nobody knows at what level the futures and stocks will open today
the de between the stock and futures markets friday will undoubtedly cause renewed debate about whether wall street is properly prepared for another crash situation
the big board ' mr grass said our <unk> performance was good
but the exchange will look at the performance of all specialists in all stocks

as small investors pepper their mutual funds with phone calls over the weekend big fund managers said they have a strong defense against any wave of withdrawal cash
unlike the weekend before black monday the funds were n swamp with heavy withdrawal requests
and many fund managers have built up cash levels and say they will be buying stock this week
at fidelity investments the nation ' largest fund company telephone volume was up sharply but it was still at just half the level of the weekend preceding black monday in N
the boston firm said stock redemption were running at less than one the level two years ago
as of yesterday afternoon the redemption represented less than N % of the total cash position of about N billion of fidelity ' stock funds
two years ago there were massive redemption levels over the weekend and a lot of fear around said c bruce <unk> who runs fidelity investments ' N billion equity fund
this feels more like a one deal
people are n panic
the test may come today
friday ' stock market sell came too late for many investors to act
some shareholders have held off until today because any fund exchanges made after friday ' close would take place at today ' closing prices
stock fund redemption during the N de did n begin to snow until after the market opened on black monday
but fund managers say they ' ready
many have raised cash levels which act as a buffer against steep market declines
mario gabe for instance holds cash positions well above N % in several of his funds
windsor fund ' john ne and mutual series ' michael price said they had raised their cash levels to more than N % and N % respectively this year
even peter lynch manager of fidelity ' N billion mage fund the nation ' largest stock fund built up cash to N % or N million
one reason is that after two years of monthly net redemption the fund posted net in of money from investors in august and september
i ' let the money build up mr lynch said who added that he has had trouble finding stocks he likes
not all funds have raised cash levels of course
as a group stock funds held N % of assets in cash as of august the latest figures available from the investment company institute
that was modest higher than the N % and N % levels in august and september of N
also persistent redemption would force some fund managers to dump stocks to raise cash
but a strong level of investor withdrawal is much more unlikely this time around fund managers said
a major reason is that investors already have sharply scaled back their purchases of stock funds since black monday
stock sales have rebound in recent months but monthly net purchases are still running at less than half N levels
there ' not nearly as much fr said john bog chairman of vanguard group inc a big valley forge pa fund company
many fund managers argue that now ' the time to buy

the jan group had a similar recording for investors

nevertheless ms ga said she was swamp with phone calls over the weekend from nervous shareholders
half of them are really scared and want to sell she said but i ' trying to talk them out of it
she added if they all were bull i ' really be upset
the backdrop to friday ' slide was markedly different from that of the october N crash fund managers argue
two years ago unlike today the dollar was weak interest rates were rising and the market was very over they say

ripple from the strike by N mach union members against boeing co reached air carriers friday as america west airlines announced it will post its new service out of houston because of delays in receiving aircraft from the seattle jet maker
peter ot vice president for planning at the phoenix ari carrier said in an interview that the work stop at boeing now entering its N day has caused some turmoil in our scheduling and that more than N passengers who were booked to fly out of houston on america west would now be put on other airlines
mr ot said boeing told america west that the N it was supposed to get this thursday would n be delivered until nov N the day after the airline had been planning to initiate service at houston with four daily flights including three nonstop to phoenix and one nonstop to las vegas
now those routes are n expected to begin until jan
boeing is also supposed to send to america west another N twin aircraft as well as a N by year ' end
those too are almost certain to arrive late
at this point no other america west flights including its new service at san antonio texas newark n and palm cal have been affected by the delays in boeing deliveries
nevertheless the company ' reaction under the <unk> effect that a huge manufacturer such as boeing can have on other parts of the economy
it also is sure to help the mach put added pressure on the company
i just do n feel that the company can really stand or would want a prolonged walk tom baker president of mach ' district N said in an interview yesterday
i do n think their customers would like it very much
america west though is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be
i figure that american and united probably have such a hard time counting all the planes in their fleets they might not miss one at all mr ot said
indeed a random check friday did n seem to indicate that the strike was having much of an effect on other airline operations
southwest airlines has a boeing N set for delivery at the end of this month and expects to have the plane on time
it ' so close to completion boeing ' told us there wo n be a problem said a southwest spokesman
a spokesman for am corp said boeing has assured american airlines it will deliver a N on time later this month
american is preparing to take delivery of another N in early december and N more next year and is n anticipating any changes in that timetable
in seattle a boeing spokesman explained that the company has been in constant communication with all of its customers and that it was impossible to predict what further disruption might be triggered by the strike
meanwhile supervisors and non employees have been trying to finish some N aircraft mostly N and N ju jets at the company ' everett wash plant that were all but completed before the walk
as of friday four had been delivered and a fifth plane a N was supposed to be flown out over the weekend to air china
no date has yet been set to get back to the bargaining table
we want to make sure they know what they want before they come back said doug hammond the federal media who has been in contact with both sides since the strike began
the investment community for one has been anticipating a speedy resolution
though boeing ' stock price was battered along with the rest of the market friday it actually has risen over the last two weeks on the strength of new orders
the market has taken two views that the labor situation will get settled in the short term and that things look very rosy for boeing in the long term said howard rub an analyst at <unk> j lawrence inc
boeing ' shares fell N friday to close at N in composite trading on the new york stock exchange
but mr baker said he thinks the earliest a pact could be struck would be the end of this month hint that the company and union may resume negotiations as early as this week
still he said it ' possible that the strike could last considerably longer
i would n expect an immediate resolution to anything
last week boeing chairman frank sh sent striking workers a letter saying that to my knowledge boeing ' offer represents the best overall three contract of any major u industrial firm in recent history
but mr baker called the letter and the company ' offer of a N % wage increase over the life of the pact plus bonuses very weak
he added that the company mis the union ' resolve and the workers ' <unk> with being forced to work many hours overtime
in separate developments talks have broken off between mach representatives at lockheed corp and the cal cal aerospace company
the union is continuing to work through its expired contract however
it had planned a strike vote for next sunday but that has been pushed back indefinitely
united auto workers local N which represents N workers at boeing ' helicopter unit in delaware county pa said it agreed to extend its contract on a day basis with a N notification to cancel while it continues bargaining
the accord expired yesterday

the planes long range versions of the medium twin will be delivered with pratt & whitney N engines

c richardson at ' senior vice president finance said its N canadian utilities ltd unit is reviewing co projects in eastern canada and conventional electric power generating plants elsewhere including britain where the british government plans to allow limited competition in electrical generation from private suppliers as part of its privatization program
the projects are big
they can be N billion plus mr richardson said
but we would n go into them alone and canadian utilities ' equity stake would be small he said
<unk> we ' like to be the operator of the project and a modest equity investor
our long suit is our proven ability to operate power plants he said

britain ' government plans to raise about N billion N billion from the sale of most of its giant water and electric utilities beginning next month
the planned electric utility sale scheduled for next year is alone expected to raise N billion making it the world ' largest public offering
under terms of the plan independent generators would be able to compete for N % of customers until N and for another N % between N and N
canadian utilities had N revenue of N billion mainly from its natural gas and electric utility businesses in alberta where the company serves about N customers
there seems to be a move around the world to der the generation of electricity mr richardson said and canadian utilities hopes to capital on it
this is a real thrust on our utility side he said adding that canadian utilities is also mu projects in under countries though he would be specific
canadian utilities is n alone in exploring power generation opportunities in britain in anticipation of the privatization program

kaufman & broad home corp said it formed a N million limited partnership subsidiary to buy land in california suitable for residential development
the partnership kaufman & broad land development venture limited partnership is a N joint venture with a trust created by institutional clients of he advisory corp a unit of he financial corp a real estate advisory management and development company with offices in chicago and beverly hills cal
kaufman & broad a home building company declined to identify the institutional investors
the land to be purchased by the joint venture has n yet received zoning and other approval required for development and part of kaufman & broad ' job will be to obtain such approval
the partnership runs the risk that it may not get the approval for development but in return it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices which can result in sizable savings said bruce kara president and chief executive officer of kaufman & broad
there are really very few companies that have adequate capital to buy properties in a raw state for cash
typically developers option property and then once they get the administrative approval they buy it said mr kara adding that he believes the joint venture is the first of its kind
we usually operate in that conservative manner
by setting up the joint venture kaufman & broad can take the more aggressive approach of buying raw land while avoiding the negative <unk> to its own balance sheet mr kara said
the company is putting up only N % of the capital although it is responsible for providing management planning and processing services to the joint venture
this is one of the best ways to assure a pipeline of land to fuel our growth at a minimum risk to our company mr kara said
when the price of plastics took off in N quantum chemical corp went along for the ride
the timing of quantum ' chief executive officer john ho st appeared to be nothing less than inspired because he had just increased quantum ' reliance on plastics
the company out much of the chemical industry as annual profit grew five in two years
mr st said of the boom it ' going to last a whole lot longer than anybody thinks
but now prices have nose and quantum ' profit is plum
some securities analysts are looking for no better than break results from the company for the third quarter compared with year profit of N million or N a share on sales of N million
the stock having lost nearly a quarter of its value since sept N closed at N share down N in new york stock exchange composite trading friday
to a degree quantum represents the new times that have arrived for producers of the so commodity plastics that per modern life
having just passed through one of the most profitable periods in their history these producers now see their prices er
pricing cycles to be sure are nothing new for plastics producers
and the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the head period that is just behind them
we were all wonderful heroes last year says an executive at one of quantum ' competitors
now we ' at the bottom of the heap
at quantum which is based in new york the trouble is mag by the company ' heavy dependence on plastics
once known as national di & chemical corp the company <unk> the wine and spirits business and pl more of its resources into plastics after mr st took the chief executive ' job in N
mr st N years old declined to be interviewed for this article but he has consistently argued that over the long haul across both the peaks and the trough of the plastics market quantum will pro through its new direction
quantum ' lot is mostly tied to poly resin used to make garbage bags milk jug house toys and meat packaging among other items
in the u poly market quantum has claimed the largest share about N %
but its competitors including dow chemical co union car corp and several oil giants have much broader business interests and so are better cushion against price swings
when the price of poly moves a mere penny a pound quantum ' annual profit flu by about N cents a share provided no other variables are changing
in recent months the price of poly even more than that of other commodity plastics has taken a dive
bench grades which still sold for as much as N cents a pound last spring have ski to between N cents and N cents
meanwhile the price of et the chemical building block of poly has n dropped nearly so fast
that disc hurts quantum badly because its own plants cover only about half of its et needs
by many accounts an early hint of a price ro in the making came at the start of this year
china which had been putting in huge orders for poly abruptly halted them
calculating that excess poly would soon be sl around the world other buyers then bet that prices had peaked and so began to draw down inventor rather than order new product
kenneth mitchell director of dow ' poly business says producers were surprised to learn how much inventor had swelled throughout the distribution chain as prices spiral up
people were even ho bags he says
now producers hope prices have hit bottom
they recently announced increases of a few cents a pound to take effect in the next several weeks
no one knows however whether the new posted prices will stick once producers and customers start to ha
one doubt is george k a chemical analyst at op & co and a bear on plastics stocks
noting others ' estimates of when price increases can be sustained he remarks some say october
some say november
i say N
he argues that efforts to firm up prices will be undermine by producers ' plans to expand production capacity
a quick turn is crucial to quantum because its cash requirements remain heavy
the company is trying to carry out a three N billion plant program started this year
at the same time its annual payments on long debt will more than double from a year ago to about N million largely because of debt taken on to pay a N special divide earlier this year
quantum described the pay at the time as a way for it to share the bon with its holders because its stock price was n reflecting the huge profit increases
some analysts saw the payment as an effort also to di takeover speculation
whether a cash crunch might eventually force the company to cut its quarterly divide raised N % to N cents a share only a year ago has become a topic of intense speculation on wall street since mr st def divide questions in a sept N meeting with analysts
some viewed his response that company directors review the divide regularly as nothing more than the standard line from executives
but others came away thinking he had given something less than his usual straight performance
in any case on the day of the meeting quantum ' shares slid N to N in big board trading
on top of everything else quantum confronts a disaster at its plant in morris ill
after an explosion idle the plant in june the company progressed in september to within N hours of completing the drawn process of restart it
then a second explosion occurred
two workers died and six remain in the hospital
this human toll adds the most painful dimension yet to the sudden change in quantum ' fortunes
until this year the company had been steadily lowering its accident rate and picking up trade safety awards
a prolonged production halt at the plant could introduce another imp into quantum ' financial future
when a plant has just been running flat out to meet demand calculating lost profit and thus claims under business insurance is <unk>
but the numbers become trick and subject to dick between ins and ins when demand is shifting
you say you could have sold x percent of this product and y percent of that recalls theodore se an analyst at shear lehman hutton who went through this exercise during his former career as a chemical engineer
and then you still have to negotiate
quantum hopes the morris plant where limited production got under way last week will resume full operation by year ' end
the plant usually accounts for N % to N % of quantum ' poly production and N % of its et production
not everything looks grim for quantum
the plant expansion should strengthen the company ' sway in the poly business where market share is often taken through sheer capacity
by lifting et production the expansion will also lower the company ' raw material costs
quantum is also tightening its grip on its one large business outside chemicals prop marketing
through a venture with its investment banker first boston corp quantum completed in august an acquisition of petrol inc in a transaction valued at N billion
petrol is the second prop distributor in the u
the largest suburban prop was already owned by quantum
still quantum has a crisis to get past right now
some analysts spec the weakening stock may yet attract a suit

the u which is final its steel quota is all a larger share of its steel market to developing and newly industrial countries which have relatively un steel industries
meanwhile the u has negotiated a significant cut in japan ' steel quota and made only a minor increase to the steel all for the european community
brazil similar to mexico and south korea is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the u market than it had under the previous five steel quota which expired sept N
brazil and venezuela are the only two countries that have n completed steel talks with the u for the year ending oct N N
in recent years u steel have supplied about N % of the N million tons of steel used annually by the nation
of the remaining N % needed the steel negotiations all about N % to foreign suppliers with the difference supplied mainly by canada which is n included in the quota program
other countries that do n have formal steel quota with the u such as taiwan sweden and argentina also have supplied steel
some of these countries have in recent years made informal agreements with the u that are similar to quota
the bush administration earlier this year said it would extend steel quota known as voluntary restraint agreements until march N N
it also said it would use that two year period to work toward an international consensus on freeing up the international steel trade which has been notorious managed sub and protected by governments
the u termed its plan a trade liberal program despite the fact that it is merely an extension
mexico which was one of the first countries to conclude its steel talks with the u virtually doubled its quota to N % of the u steel market from N % under the previous quota
south korea which had N % under the previous quota is set to get a small increase to about N %
that increase rises to slightly more than N % of the u market if a joint korean steel project is included
meanwhile brazil is expected to increase its allowance from the N % share it has had in recent years
the ec and japan the u ' largest steel suppliers have n been filling their quota to the full extent
the ec steel industry which has been coping with strong european demand has been supplying about N % of the u market compared with recent quota of about N %
japan has been shipping steel to total about N % of the u market compared with a quota of N %
in the recent talks the ec had its quota increased about N tons to N % of the u market from N % in N
but its quota has been as high as N % in N
japan however has agreed to cut its quota to about N % from N % previously
japan the ec brazil mexico and south korea provide about N % of the steel imported to the u under the quota program
the balance is supplied by a host of smaller export such as australia and venezuela
the u had about an extra N % of the domestic steel market to give to foreign suppliers in its quota talks
that was essentially made up of a N % increase in the overall quota program and N % from cutting japan ' allowance
ne from the white house trade office will repeat these quota negotiations next year when they will have another N % of the u steel market to all
these optional N increases to the steel quota program are built into the bush administration ' steel program to give its ne leverage with foreign steel suppliers to try to get them to withdraw subsidies and protection from their own steel industries
el inc expects fiscal second earnings to trail N results but anti that several new products will lead to a much stronger performance in its second half
el a telecommunications company had net income of N or five cents a share in its year second quarter ended sept N
revenue totaled N million
george pierce chairman and chief executive officer said in an interview that earnings in the most recent quarter will be about two cents a share on revenue of just under N million
the lower results mr pierce said reflect a N decline in industry sales of privately owned pay telephone el ' primary business
although mr pierce expects that line of business to strengthen in the next year he said el will also benefit from moving into other areas
foremost among those is the company ' entrance into the public fa business mr pierce said
within the next year el expects to place N fa machines made by min in japan in hotels municipal buildings drugs and other public <unk> around the country
el will provide a credit reader for the machines to collect store and forward billing data
mr pierce said el should realize a minimum of N of recurring net earnings for each machine each month
el has also developed an automatic call processor that will make further use of the company ' system for auto and handling credit calls and collect calls
automatic call processors will provide that system for virtually any telephone mr pierce said not just phones produced by el
the company will also be producing a new line of convenience telephone which do n accept coins for use in hotel lo office lo <unk> lounge and similar <unk>

measuring cups may soon be replaced by tables in the laundry room
pro & gamble co plans to begin testing next month a super deter that will require only a few spoon per wash
the move stems from lessons learned in japan where local competitors have had phenomena success with concentrated soap
it also marks p ' growing concern that its japanese rivals such as ka corp may bring their super to the u
the cincinnati consumer giant got cl two years ago in japan when ka introduced a powerful deter called attack which quickly won a N % stake in the japanese markets
they do n want to get caught again says one industry watch
retailers in phoenix ari say p ' new powder deter to be called cheer with color guard will be on shelves in that market by early november
a p spoke confirmed that shipments to phoenix started late last month
she said the company will study results from this market before expanding to others
super are n entirely new for p
the company introduced a super lemon cheer in japan after watching the success of attack
when attack hit the shelves in N p ' share of the japanese market fell to about N % from more than N %
with the help of lemon cheer p ' share is now estimated to be N %
while the japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products the true test for p will be in the N billion u deter market where growth is slow and <unk> have gained prominence over powder
the company may have chosen to market the product under the cheer name since it ' already expanded its best tide into N different <unk> including this year ' big hit tide with b
with super however it is n always easy to persuade consumers that less is more many people tend to dump too much deter into the <unk> machine believing that it takes a cup of powder to really clean the laundry
in the early N p tried to launch here a concentrated deter under the <unk> brand name that it markets in europe
but the product which was n as concentrated as the new cheer bombed in a market test in denver and was dropped
p and others also have tried repeatedly to hook consumers on deter and fabric soft <unk> in <unk> but they have n sold well despite the convenience
but p contend the new cheer is a unique formula that also offers an ingredient that prevents colors from <unk>
and retailers are expected to embrace the product in part because it will take up less shelf space
when shelf space was cheap bigger was better says hugh zur an analyst at sal bros
but with so many brands v for space that ' no longer the case
if the new cheer sells well the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their own super
then retailers will probably push the less brands out altogether he says
competition is bound to get tough if ka introduces a product like attack in the u
to be sure ka would n have an easy time taking u market share away from the mighty p which has about N % of the market
ka officials previously have said they are interested in selling deter in the u but so far the company has focused on acquisitions such as last year ' purchase of andrew je co a cincinnati hand maker
it also has a product facility in california
some believe p ' interest in a super deter goes beyond the concern for the japanese
this is something p would do with or without ka says mr zur
with economic tension between the u and japan worse many japanese had feared last week ' visit from u trade representative carla hills
they expected a new barrage of demands that japan do something quickly to reduce its trade surplus with the u
instead they got a discussion of the need for the u and japan to work together and of the importance of the long view
mrs hills ' first trip to japan as america ' chief trade ne had a completely different tone from last month ' visit by commerce secretary robert a mo
mr mo called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental japanese business practices that supposedly inhibit free trade
he said such results should be me in dollars and cents in reducing the u trade deficit with japan
but mrs hills speaking at a breakfast meeting of the american chamber of commerce in japan on saturday stressed that the objective is not to get definitive action by spring or summer it is rather to have a blue for action
she added that she expected perhaps to have a down payment some small step to convince the american people and the japanese people that we ' moving in earnest
how such remarks translate into policy wo n become clear for months
american and japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach bet mr mo and mrs hills
many called it simply a contrast in styles
but some saw it as a classic negotiating tactic
others said the bush administration may feel the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand
and some said it reflected the growing debate in washington over pursuing free trade with japan versus some kind of managed trade
asked to compare her visit to mr mo ' mrs hills replied i did n hear every word he spoke but as a general proposition i think we have a very consistent trade strategy in the bush administration
yet more than one american official who sat in with her during three days of talks with japanese officials said her tone often was surprisingly con
i think my line has been very consistent mrs hills said at a news conference saturday afternoon
i am painted sometimes as ferocious perhaps because i have a ferocious list of statutes to implement
i do n feel very ferocious
i do n feel either hard or soft
i feel committed to the program of opening markets and expanding trade
when she met the local press for the first time on friday mrs hills firmly reiterated the need for progress in removing barriers to trade in forest products <unk> and super three areas targeted under the super N provision of the N trade bill
she highlighted exclusion business practices that the u government has identified
but her main thrust was to promote the importance of world free trade and open competition
she said the trade im was mainly due to macro factors and should n be <unk> by setting quantitative targets
at her news conference for japanese reporters one economics journalist sum up the japanese sense of relief
my impression was that you would be a scary old lady he said drawing a few nervous <unk> from his colleagues
but i am relieved to see that you are beautiful and gentle and intelligent and a person of integrity
mrs hills ' remarks did raise questions at least among some u officials about what exactly her stance is on u access to the japanese semiconductor market
the u share of the japanese market has been stuck around N % for years
many americans have interpreted a N agreement as ass u companies a N % share by N but the japanese have denied making any such promise
at one of her news conferences mrs hills said i believe we can do much better than N %
but she stressed i am against managed trade
i will not enter into an agreement that st to a percentage of the market

the oil industry ' mid profits could persist through the rest of the year
major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profit
the gasoline picture may improve this quarter but chemicals are likely to remain weak industry executives and analysts say reducing chances that profits could equal their year performance
the industry is seeing a soft somewhat in volume and certainly in price in pet glenn cox president of phillips petroleum co said in an interview
that change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings for the industry in general he added
he did n forecast phillips ' results
but securities analysts say phillips will be among the companies hard by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third earnings
so too many analysts predict will ex corp che corp and am corp
typical is what happened to the price of et a major commodity chemical produced in vast amounts by many oil companies
it has plunged N % since july to around N cents a pound
a year ago et sold for N cents <unk> at about N cents last december
a big reason for the chemical price retreat is over
beginning in N prices began accelerating as a growing u economy and the weak dollar spurred demand
companies added capacity <unk>
now greatly increased supplies are on the market while the dollar is stronger and domestic economic growth is slower
third profits from gasoline were weaker
refining margins were so good in the third quarter of last year and generally not very good this year said william rand a securities analyst at first boston corp
oil company ref ran flat out to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in july and august that did n material
the excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period
in addition crude oil prices were up some from a year earlier further press profit
ref say margins picked up in september and many industry officials believe gasoline profits will rebound this quarter though still not to the level of N ' fourth quarter
during the N second half many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits
crude oil production may turn out to be the most surprising element of companies ' earnings this year
prices averaging roughly N a barrel higher in the third quarter than a year earlier have stayed well above most companies ' expectations
demand has been much stronger than anticipated and it typically accelerate in the fourth quarter
we could see higher oil prices this year said bryan jacob an analyst at pain inc
that will translate into sharply higher production profits particularly compared with last year when oil prices steadily fell to below N a barrel in the fourth quarter
while oil prices have been better than expected natural gas prices have been worse
in the third quarter they averaged about N % less than they were in N
the main reason remains weather
last summer was notable for a heat wave and drought that caused utilities to burn more natural gas to feed increased electrical demand from air conditioning use
this summer on the other hand had mild weather than usual
we ' been very disappointed in the performance of natural gas prices said mr cox phillips ' president
the la gas price is not going to assist fourth quarter performance as many had expected
going into the fourth quarter natural gas prices are anywhere from N % to N % lower than a year earlier
for instance natural gas currently produced along the gulf coast is selling on the spot market for around N a thousand cubic feet down N % from N a thousand cubic feet a year ago
the bush administration trying to blunt growing demands from western europe for a relaxation of controls on exports to the soviet bloc is questioning whether italy ' ing c olive & co supplied mil valuable technology to the soviets
most of the western european members of <unk> committee on multi export controls the unofficial forum through which the u and its allies <unk> their export policies are expected to argue for more liberal export rules at a meeting to be held in paris oct N and N
they plan to press specifically for a relaxation of rules governing exports of machine tools computers and other high products
but the bush administration says it wants to see evidence that all coco members are comply fully with existing export procedures before it will support further liberal
to make its point it is challenging the italian government to explain reports that olive may have supplied the soviet union with sophisticated computer devices that could be used to build parts for combat aircraft
the london sunday times which first reported the u concerns cited a u intelligence report as the source of the allegations that olive exported N million in em state flexible manufacturing systems to the soviet aviation industry
olive reportedly began shipping these tools in N
a state department spokesman acknowledged that the u is discussing the allegations with the italian government and coco but declined to confirm any details
italian president <unk> co promised a quick investigation into whether olive broke coco rules
president bush called his attention to the matter during the italian leader ' visit here last week
olive has denied that it violated coco rules asserting that the reported shipments were properly licensed by the italian authorities
although the legal of these sales is still an open question the disclosure could n be better timed to support the position of export hawks in the pentagon and the intelligence community
it seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important coco meeting said a washington lobby for a number of u computer companies
the bush administration has sent conflicting signals about its export policies reflecting un divisions among several competing agencies
last summer mr bush moved the administration in the direction of gradual liberal when he told a north atlantic treaty organization meeting that he would allow some exceptions to the coco em of strategic goods
but more recently the pentagon and the commerce department openly feud over the extent to which coco should liberal exports of personal computers to the bloc
however these agencies generally agree that the west should be cautious about any further liberal
there ' no evidence that the soviet program to illegally acquire western technology has diminished said a state department spokesman

while corn and soy prices have slumped well below their drought peaks of N wheat prices remain stubborn high

for one thing even with many farmers planting more winter wheat this year than last tight wheat supplies are likely to support prices well into N the analysts say
and if rain does n fall soon across many of the great plains ' wheat areas yields in the crop now being planted could be reduced further squeezing supplies
also supporting prices are expectations that the soviet union will place substantial buying orders over the next few months

that would be the lowest level since the early N

it now estimates production for next year at just under N billion bush compared with this year ' estimated N billion and a drought N billion in N
but the full effect on prices of the winter wheat now being planted wo n be felt until the second half of next year

in july the cb ordered fe fin s a to liquid futures positions equal to about N million bush of soy

late thursday after the close of trading the market received what would normally have been a bull u department of agriculture estimate of the N florida orange crop
it was near the low range of estimates at N million N boxes compared with N million boxes last season
however as expected brazil waited for the crop estimate to come out and then cut the export price of its juice concentrate to about N a pound from around N
friday ' con selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the u report might have had and sent the november orange juice contract down as much as N cents a pound at one time

general motors corp in a series of moves that angered union officials in the u and canada has signaled that as many as five north american assembly plants may not survive the N as the corporation struggles to cut its excess vehicle capacity
in announcements to workers late last week gm effectively signed death notices for two full van assembly plants and cast serious doubt on the futures of three u car factories
gm is under intense pressure to close factories that became un as the giant auto maker ' u market share ski during the past decade
the company currently using about N % of its north american vehicle capacity has vowed it will run at N % of capacity by N
just a month ago gm announced it would make an aging assembly plant in lake ga the eighth u assembly facility to close since N
now gm appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation to get in shape for the N
one reason is mounting competition from new japanese car plants in the u that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than gm can match
another is that united auto workers union officials have signaled they want tighter no provisions in the new big three national contract that will be negotiated next year
gm officials want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work force in place before those talks begin
the problem however is that gm ' moves are coming at a time when ua leaders are trying to silence di who charge the union is too passive in the face of gm lay
against that backdrop ua vice president stephen p yo who recently became head of the union ' gm department issued a statement friday <unk> gm ' flag ins toward union members
the auto maker ' decision to let word of the latest shut and product re trickle out in separate com to the affected plants showed di and an inability or unwilling to provide consistent information mr yo said
gm officials told workers late last week of the following moves production of full vans will be consolidated into a single plant in flint mic
that means two plants one in <unk> ontario and the other in lords ohio probably will be shut down after the end of N
the shut will idle about N canadian assembly workers and about N workers in ohio
robert white canadian auto workers union president used the impending <unk> shut to critic the u free trade agreement and its champion prime minister brian mu
but canadian auto workers may benefit from a separate gm move that affects three u car plants and one in quebec

that announcement left union officials in van nu and oklahoma city uncertain about their futures
the van nu plant which employs about N workers does n have a product to build after N
jerry shri ua local president said the facility was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a flex plant which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand
at the oklahoma city plant which employs about N workers building the eight a mid cars steve <unk> ua local vice president said the plant has no new product lined up and none of us knows when the a cars will die
he said he believes gm has plans to keep building a cars into the N
at pontiac however the cam decision appears to erase ua hopes that gm would re the shutter assembly plant that last built the plastic two pontiac fi model
the fi plant was viewed as a model of union cooperation at gm before slow sales of the fi forced the company to close the factory last year
union officials have taken a beating politically as a result
di ua members have used the fi plant as a symbol of labor cooperation ' failure
institut mer s of france said the canadian government raised an obstacle to its proposed acquisition of con bio inc for N million canadian dollars N million
mer said the government ' minister of industry science and technology told it that he was n convinced that the purchase is likely to be of net benefit to canada
canadian investment rules require that big foreign takeover meet that standard

vi me a partner with me & <unk> a new york pharmaceutical industry research firm said the government ' ruling was n unexpected
this has become a very pol deal concerning canada ' only large world bio or pharmaceutical company mr me said
mr me said the move that could allow the transaction to go ahead as planned could be an out settlement of con ' dispute with the university of toronto
the university is seeking to block the acquisition of con by foreign interests citing concerns about the amount of research that would be done in canada
the university is considering a settlement proposal made by con
while neither side will disclose its contents mr me expects it to contain more specific guarantees on research and development spending levels in canada than mer offered to investment canada
some analysts such as murray gross of toronto richardson greens inc believe the government ruling leaves the door open for other bid such as switzerland ' ci and chi corp of emery cal
officials for the two concerns which are bidding N a share for con could n be reached for comment

analysts said that mer & co eli lilly & co warner co and the sq corp unit of bristol sq co all benefited from strong sales of relatively new higher medicines that provide wide profit margins

the company was officially merged with bristol co earlier this month
bristol declined to comment
mr <unk> of bear ste said that sc corp ' expected profit rise of about N % to N % and bristol ' expected profit increase of about N % are largely because those companies are really managed well

in N the epa notified gulf resources which was a part of the sm that it was potentially liable for sharing cleanup costs at the site under the federal super program

this is a reaction to artificial lb valuation rather than to any fundamental said john young chairman of he co whose shares dropped N to N
if we get rid of a lot of that nonsense it will be a big plus
a few of the executives here for the fall meeting of the business council a group that meets to discuss national issues were only too happy to personal their criticism
people wish the government would do something about leverage buy do something about takeover do something about donald trump said rand ara chairman of it corp whose stock dropped N

the real estate slump that ' pushing down the price of new york office space and housing is also affecting the city ' retail real estate market
in manhattan once store sites sit vacant and newly constructed space has been slow to fill
retail real estate broker say tenants are reluctant to sign leases because of uncertainty about the local economy turmoil in their own industries and a belief that rents have not yet hit bottom
there is an unbelievable amount of space available says faith con senior vice president at ga associates store leasing inc
there are about N stores for rent up from a more typical range of N to N
this further confuse retailers she says
they wonder should they sign a lease if prices are still coming down
is this the wrong time to open a store
who is going to be in the space next door
in addition ms con says tenants usually can negotiate to pay rents that are about one lower than landlord ' initial asking price
a handful of hot retail locations such as the N street and madison and fifth avenue areas have been able to sustain what many see as astronomical rents
and in some neighborhoods rents have merely hit a plateau
but on average manhattan retail rents have dropped N % to N % in the past six months alone experts say
that follows a more subtle decline in the prior six months after manhattan rents had run up rapidly since N
the same factors limiting demand for office space have affected retail
as businesses contract or <unk> the number of employees who might use retail services shrink says edward a friedman senior vice president of helm spear inc
he says financial problems pl electronics fur and furniture companies key categories in the local retail economy have further def the market
hardest hit are what he calls secondary sites that primarily serve neighborhood residents
in these locations mr friedman says retailers are increasingly cautious about expanding and rents have remained steady or in some cases have declined
weakness in the restaurant industry which is leaving retail space vacant ex the problem for landlord
it is also no comfort to landlord and small new york retailers when the future of larger department stores which anchor retail neighborhoods are in doubt
hooker corp parent of bon teller and b alt ' is mir in bankruptcy proceedings and bloom ' is for sale by its owner camp corp
the trend toward lower rents may seem surprising given that some communities in new york are be the loss of favorite local businesses to high rents
but despite the recent soft for many of these retailers there ' still been too big a jump from the rental rates of the late N when their leases were signed
certainly the recent drop in prices does n mean manhattan comes cheap
new york retail rents still run well above the going rate in other u cities
madison and fifth avenues and east N street can command rents of up to N a square foot and N is not uncommon
the thriving N street area offers rents of about N a square foot as do up locations along lower fifth avenue
by contrast rental in the best retail locations in boston san francisco and chicago rarely top N a square foot

when justice william <unk> marks the start of his N year on the supreme court today the occasion will differ sharply from previous ann of his tenure
for the first time the N justice finds his influence almost exclusively in dissent rather than as a force in the high court ' majority
this role reversal holds true as well for his three liberal and moderate allies justices th marshall harry black and john stevens
but are these four players three of them in their N ready to assume a different role after N years collectively of service on the high court
every indication is that the four are prepared to accept this new role and the frustration that go with it but in different ways
justices <unk> and stevens appear philosophical about it justices marshall and black appear fighting mad
the four justices are no newcomers to dissent often joining forces in the past decade to critic the court ' conservative drift
but always in years past they have buck the trend and have been able to pick up a fifth vote to ek out a number of major victories in civil rights and liberties cases
now however as the court ' new five conservative majority continues to solid victories for the liberals are rare
the change is most dramatic for justice <unk> the last survivor of the N liberal majority under chief justice earl warren
in the seven supreme court terms from the fall of N through the spring of N the height of the warren court ' power justice <unk> cast only N dissent votes in N cases decided by the court
last term alone he cast N dissent votes in N decisions with the contentious flag ruling as his only big victory
but justice <unk> fore his new role strongly defending the importance of dissent in a N speech
each time the court rev an issue the justices will be forced by a dissent to rec the fundamental questions and to re the result he said
moreover in recent months he has said that when he was on the winning side in the N he knew that the tables might turn in the future
he has said that he now knows how justice john harlan felt a reference to the late conservative justice who was the most frequent dissent from the warren court ' opinions
associates of N justice marshall say he was depressed about the court ' direction last spring but is <unk> about his role and determined to speak out against the court ' cut in civil rights
we could sweep it under the <unk> and hide it but i ' not going to do it he said in a speech last month
he like justice <unk> considers dissent highly important for the future a point that has n escaped legal scholars
harvard law school professor laurence tribe says there is a generation flavor to current dissent
the dissent in the warren court he says appeared to be writing for the short suggesting that the court ' direction might change soon
<unk> and marshall are speaking in their dissent to a more distant future he says
justice black who will turn N next month also seems <unk> about his new role
associates say he takes some defeats more personally than his colleagues especially attempts to curt the right to abortion first recognized in his N opinion roe vs wade
friends and associates who saw justice black during the summer said he was no more discouraged about the court than in recent years
and his outlook improved after successful cat surgery in august
but his level of frustration showed in a recent imp speech to a group of hundreds of lawyers in chicago
he concluded his remarks by quoting emotionally and at some length according to those present the late martin luther king ' famous i have a dream speech from the N march on washington
justice stevens N is probably the most philosophical of the dissent about his role in part because he may be the least liberal of the four but also because he enjoys the intellectual challenge of arguing with the majority more than the others
if the role these four dissent are assuming is a familiar one in modern supreme court history it also <unk> in an important way from recent history court watch say
the dissent of the warren court were often defending a legal legacy that they inherited says prof a dick howard of the university of virginia law school but the dissent today are defending a legacy that they created

nc for example has been one of the highest rate pay in the texas market and in florida rates are especially sensitive in retirement communities

however because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered ad rates will be effectively N % higher per sub according to richard he time associate publisher
time is following the course of some other mass magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing <unk> that maintaining artificial high and expensive circulation is the way to draw ad
in recent years reader ' digest new york times co ' mccall ' and most recently news corp ' tv guide have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate marginal circulation and hold down rates for ad
deep discount in subscription and offers of free clock radios and watches have become accepted forms of attracting new subscribers in the hyper world of magazine news
but time as part of the more cost time warner wants to we itself away from expensive gi
besides time executives think selling a news magazine with a clock radio is tack
give just give people the wrong image said mr he
that perception takes the focus off the magazine
time magazine executives predict paint the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to ad
what we are doing is screening out the readers who are only <unk> related to the magazine and do n really read it said mr he
we are trying to create quality and involvement
however time executives used the same explanation when in october N the magazine cut its guaranteed circulation from N million to N million
and time ' paid circulation according to audit bureau of circulation dropped N % to N in the six months ended june N N
still time ' move is being received well once again
it ' terrific for ad to know the reader will be paying more said michael dr national media director at bo inc ad agency
a few drops in circulation are of no consequence
it ' not a show of weakness they are improving the quality of circulation while ins their profits
mr he said the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry a magazine ' net revenue per sub or the actual revenue from subscribers after discount and the cost of premium have been stripped away
the question is how much are we getting from each reader said mr he
time ' rivals news washington post co ' newsweek and u news & world report are less re on electronic give and in recent years both have been increasing their circulation rate bases
both magazines are expected to announce their ad rates and circulation levels for N within a month
when the news broke of an attempted coup in panama two weeks ago sen christopher dodd called the state department for a briefing
they said follow cnn he told reporters
that shows how far ted turner ' cable news network has come since its birth nine years ago when it was considered the laughing of television news
it is bigger faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks
its niche as the network of record during major crises draws elite audiences around the world
but for all its success cnn has hit a plateau
although viewers so when big news breaks it e during periods of calm
cnn executives worry that the network ' punch but <unk> news format may be getting stale and wo n keep viewers coming back as the alternatives multi for news and information on cable
just the fact we ' on N hours is no longer bulletin says ed turner cnn ' executive vice president news gathering and no relation to ted turner
you ca n live on that
so cnn a unit of atlanta turner broadcasting system inc is trying to rep itself as a primary channel or what people in the television industry call a top of mind network
tonight to kick off the effort cnn will premiere its first prime <unk> in years an hour show at N p eastern time to air head against the network <unk>
the show will be co by bernard shaw and catherine cr a N former texas judge and campus beauty queen who has never held a job in television or journalism
the new show is perhaps the bold in a number of steps the network is taking to build audience loyalty by shifting away from its current format toward more full signature programming with recognizable stars
to distinguish itself cnn is also expanding international coverage and adding a second global program
it is paying higher salaries after years of sc to lure and keep experienced staff
and it is embark on an expensive gamble to break major stories with a large investigative team
the next stage is to get beyond the opinion leaders who use us as a point of reference to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables says jon pet executive vice president of headline news cnn ' sister network
but that wo n be easy
networks like other consumer products develop images in peoples ' minds that are n easy to change
it also takes money that cnn has been reluctant to spend to make programs and hire talent that viewers will tune in specially to see
and the cable operators cnn ' distributors and part owners like things just the way they are
the rep bid is aimed at cnn ' un viewers and what may happen to it as the cable news market grows more competitive
already cnn is facing stronger competition from financial news network inc and general electric co ' consumer news and business channel both of which are likely to pursue more general news in the future
in addition many cable systems themselves are airing more local and regional news programs produced by local broadcast stations
cnn wants to change its viewers ' habits
its watch are on the whole a di group of channel <unk> and news junk who spend an average of just N minutes a day watching cnn according to audience research
that ' less than one the time that viewers watch the major broadcast networks
the brief attention viewers give cnn could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data and advertising become more important to cable channels
cnn ' <unk> habits have been <unk> by its format
its strategy in the past has been to serve as a tv wire service
it focused on building up its news bureau around the world so as events took place it could go live quicker and longer than other networks
it filled its daily schedule with <unk> called day day news and news but the shows varied little in content personality or look
now the push is on for more shows
our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity says paul <unk> cnn executive vice president for programming
accordingly cnn is adding a world show in the morning because surveys show its global hour in the afternoon is among its most <unk> programs in viewers ' minds says mr <unk>
and it is exploring other original programs similar to its larry king live and cross talk shows which executives hope will keep people tuned in
then there ' the world today the prime <unk> featuring mr shaw and ms cr
until now cnn has featured its hollywood gossip show during the key evening period
but N % of the cable households that watch news do so between N p and N p the network discovered so cnn wants in
mr <unk> says the shaw team will probably do two live interviews a day with most of the program at least for now appearing similar to cnn ' other new
some in the industry are skeptical
i find it hard to con of people switching over to cnn for what at least in the public ' mind is the same news says re frank the former two president of nbc news and creator of the hunt report
the evening news is also slated as cnn ' stage for its big push into investigative journalism
in august the network hired award producer pamela hill the former head of news specials at abc
she ' ass a staff of about N investigative reporters who will produce weekly in segments with an eye toward breaking big stories
cnn executives hope the headlines created by such scoop will generate excitement for its <unk> programs in the way N minutes did so well for cbs
that ' such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical cnn will follow through with its investigative commitment especially after it sees the cost of producing in pieces
they ' never shown any inclination to spend money on production says michael mo a senior producer with mac news who notes that cnn is ind to his job
the network ' salaries have always ranged far below industry standards resulting in a less work force
cnn recently gave most employees raises of as much as N % but they ' still drastically under compared with the networks
says mr mo cnn is my wire service they ' on top of everything
but to improve they ' really got to make the investment in people
in any case cable operators have reason to fear any tin with cnn ' format
they market cable on the very <unk> opportunities cnn seeks to discourage
we would obviously be upset if those kinds of services evolved into more general long programming says robert ste senior vice president programming of continental cable inc which holds a N % stake in turner broadcasting
the second u circuit court of appeals opinion in the <unk> <unk> case did not rep the position penn co took in its dispute with tex contrary to your sept N article court backs tex ' view in penn case too late

in the penn litigation the courts found penn and get oil intended to be bound in <unk> <unk> they found there was no intention to be bound

but the outcome of a legal dispute almost always turns on the facts

charles f vi
valley federal savings & loan association said imperial corp of america withdrew from regulators its application to buy five valley federal branches leaving the transaction in limb
the broken purchase appears as additional evidence of trouble at imperial corp whose spokesman said the company withdrew its application from the federal office of th supervision because of an informal notice that imperial ' th unit failed to meet community rein act requirements
the community rein act requires savings and loan associations to lend money in amounts related to areas where deposits are received
the transaction announced in august included about N million in deposits at the five outlets in california ' san <unk> valley
terms were n disclosed but valley federal had said it expected to post a modest pre gain and to save about N million in operating costs annually
valley federal said friday that it is considering whether to seek another buyer for the branches or to pursue the transaction with imperial corp which said it is attempting to meet community rein act requirements

lawyers for dozens of ins savings and loan associations are trying a new tack in their efforts to def suits filed by borrow developers and creditors
the th ' lawyers claim that the suits <unk> N to N in texas alone should be dismissed as mo because neither the s nor the <unk> federal savings and loan insurance corp has the money to pay judgments
though the argument may have a common ring to it even the s lawyers con there ' little precedent to back their position
still one federal appeals court has signaled it ' willing to <unk> the notion and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in texas and eight other states where the defense is permitted under state law
the dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward clearing court dock in texas and reducing the f ' massive legal bills which topped N million last year
the s lawyers were encouraged last month by an appellate ruling in two cases brought against defunct sun savings & loan association of dallas by the developers of the valley ranch best known as the training center for the dallas cowboys football team
sun fore on the ranch
sun and the f argued to the fifth u circuit court of appeals that there will never be any assets with which to satisfy a judgment against sun savings nor any means to collect from any other party including f
if true the court wrote this contention would justify dismissal of these actions on pr grounds
but the court said it lacked enough financial information about sun and the f and sent the cases back to federal district court in dallas
charles ha a lawyer for sun says he plans to file a brief this week urging the district judge to dismiss the suits because sun ' lia exceeded its assets by about N billion when federal regulators closed it in august N
this institution is just brain dead says mr ha a partner in the dallas office of andrews & kurt a houston law firm
but a lawyer for tri investment group the developer of valley ranch dismiss such arguments as a defense du jo

september ' steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still persist and the pe over interest rates caused by the new price data contributed to the stock market ' plunge friday
after falling for three consecutive months the producer price index for finished goods shot up N % last month the labor department reported friday as energy prices jumped after tumbling through the summer
although the report which was released before the stock market opened did n trigger the N drop in the dow jones industrial average analysts said it did play a role in the market ' decline
analysts immediately viewed the price data the grimm inflation news in months as evidence that the federal reserve was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall as many investors had hoped
further fuel the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the fed from easing credit the commerce department reported friday that retail sales grew N % in september to N billion
that rise came on top of a N % gain in august and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy
i think the friday report combined with the actions of the fed weakened the belief that there was going to be an imminent easing of monetary policy said robert de chief economist at northern trust co in chicago
but economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled by the new numbers
the overall N % increase is serious in itself but what is even worse is that excluding food and energy the producer price index still increased by N % said gordon richards an economist at the national association of manufacturers
but sung won so chief economist at nor corp in minneapolis blamed rising energy prices and the annual autumn increase in car prices for most of the september jump
i would say this is not bad news this is a b he said
the core rate is not really out of line
all year energy prices have sk the producer price index which measures changes in the prices producers receive for goods
inflation un has fallen back from its tor pace last winter when a steep run in world oil prices sent the index sur at double annual rates
energy prices then plum through the summer causing the index to decline for three consecutive months
overall the index has climbed at a N % compound annual rate since the start of the year the labor department said
while far more restrained than the pace at the beginning of the year that is still a steep rise than the N % increase for all of N
moreover this year ' good inflation news may have ended last month when energy prices zoom up N % after plunging N % in august
some analysts expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in the months ahead leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain
analysts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index but the N % climb was higher than most anticipated
i think the resurgence in inflation is going to continue for a few months said john <unk> chief economist at bell <unk> cannon a washington economic forecast firm
he predicted that inflation will moderate next year saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world
but dirk van dong president of the national association of wholesale said that last month ' rise is n as bad an om as the N % figure suggests
if you examine the data carefully the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices rather than being a broad advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods he explained
passenger car prices jumped N % in september after climbing N % in august and declining in the late spring and summer
many analysts said the september increase was a one event coming as dealers introduced their N models
although all the price data were adjusted for normal seasonal fluctuations car prices rose beyond the customary autumn increase
prices for capital equipment rose a he N % in september while prices for home electronic equipment fell N %
food prices declined N % after climbing N % in august
meanwhile the retail sales report showed that car sales rose N % in september to N billion
but at least part of the increase could have come from higher prices analysts said
sales at general merchandise stores rose N % after declining N % in august while sales of building materials fell N % after rising N %
producer prices for intermediate goods grew N % in september after dropping for three consecutive months
prices for crude goods an array of raw materials jumped N % after declining N % in august and ed up N % in july

city financial corp said it expects to report a loss of at least N million to N million for the third quarter
in the year period city had net income of N but no per earnings
city ' president and chief executive officer john at said the loss stems from several factors
he said non assets rose to slightly more than N million from N million between june and september
approximately N % of the total consisted of non commercial real estate assets
accordingly city estimated that it will provide between N million and N million for credit losses in the third quarter
city added that significant additional loan provisions may be required by federal regulators as part of the current annual examination of city federal savings bank city ' primary subsidiary based in somerset n
city federal operates N banking offices in new jersey and florida
mr at said city will also mark its portfolio of high corporate bonds to market as a result of federal legislation requiring that savings institutions dive themselves of such bonds
that action city said will result in a charge against third results of approximately N million
city also said it expects to shed its remaining mortgage loan origin operations outside its principal markets in new jersey and florida and as a result is taking a charge for discontinued operations
all these actions mr at said will result in a loss of N million to N million for the third quarter
he added however depending on the resolution of certain accounting issues relating to mortgage servicing and the outcome of the annual examination of city federal currently in progress with respect to the appropriate level of loan loss reserves the total loss for the quarter could significantly exceed this range
cent savings bank said federal th regulators ordered it to suspend divide payments on its two classes of preferred stock indicating that regulators ' concerns about the troubled institution have heightened
in a statement miami cent said the regulators cited the th ' operating losses and apparent losses in its junk portfolio in ordering the suspension of the divide
regulators also ordered cent to stop buying back the preferred stock
david l paul chairman and chief executive officer criticized the federal office of th supervision which issued the directive saying it was inappropriate and based on insufficient reasons
he said the th will try to get regulators to reverse the decision
the suspension of a preferred stock divide is a serious step that signals that regulators have deep concerns about an institution ' health
in march regulators labeled cent a troubled institution largely because of its big junk holdings and its operating losses
in the same month the office of th supervision ordered the institution to stop paying common stock divide until its operations were on track
for the nine months ended june N cent had a net loss of N million compared with year net income of N million
cent which is florida ' largest th holds one of the largest junk portfolio of any th in the nation
since april it has par its high bond holdings to about N million from N billion
mr paul said only about N million of the current holdings are trade securities registered with the securities and exchange commission
the remainder he said are commercial loan participation or private placement that are n filed with the sec and do n have a ready market
cent and regulators have been in a dispute over market valuation for the junk bonds
the office of th supervision has been <unk> cent to provide current market values for its holdings but cent has said it ca n easily obtain such values because of the relative ill of the bonds and lack of a ready market
regulators have become increasingly <unk> about cent ' and other th ' junk holdings in light of the recent federal th bail legislation and the recent deep decline in the junk market
the legislation requires th to dive themselves of junk bonds in the new <unk> regulatory climate
in american stock exchange composite trading friday cent common shares closed at N down N cents
in a statement friday mr paul challenged the regulators ' decision saying the th ' operating losses and apparent junk losses have been substantially offset by gains in other activities of the bank
he also said substantial reserves have been set aside for possible losses from the junk bonds
in the third quarter for instance cent added N million to its general reserves
mr paul said the regulators should instead move ahead with app cent ' request to sell N of its N branches to great western bank a unit of great western financial corp based in beverly hills cal
the branch sale is the center of cent ' strategy to transform itself into a traditional s from a high institution that relied heavily on securities trading for profits according to mr paul
most analysts and th executives had expected a decision on the proposed transaction which was announced in july long before now
many interpret the delay as an indication that regulators are skeptical about the proposal
branches and deposits can be sold at a premium in the event federal regulators take over an institution
cent however to the branch sale saying it would bring in N million and reduce the th ' assets to N billion from N billion
it said the sale would give it positive tangible capital of N million or about N % of assets from a negative N million as of sept N thus bringing cent close to regulatory standards
cent said the branch sale would also reduce the company ' large amount of good will by about N million
critics however say the branch sale will make cent more dependent than ever on broker deposits and junk bonds
mr paul counters that he intends to further par the size of cent by not renew more than N billion of broker certificates of deposit when they come due
the th is also working to un its junk portfolio by continuing to sell off the bonds and it plans to eventually place some of them in a separate affiliate as required under the new th law

the woman won the bet
but perhaps even more remarkable the three wet das make a bet regularly wins the top slot in the country ' tv ratings sometimes drawing as many as N % of west german households
as the N economic integration approaches europe ' cultural curator have taken to the ramp against american cultural <unk> threatening to impose quota against such pop <unk> as dallas miami vice and l law
but much of what the europeans want to protect seems every bit as che as what they are trying to keep out
the most militant opposition to american tv imports has come from french television and movie producers who have demanded quota ensuring that a full N % of europe ' tv shows be produced in europe
so far the french have failed to win enough broad support to pre
a glance through the television listings and a few twists of the european television dial suggest one reason why
while there are some popular action and drama series few bo the high culture and class production values one might expect
more european air time is filled with low game shows variety hours movies and talk shows many of which are authorized knock of their american counterparts
one of france ' most popular saturday night programs features semi seeking out their <unk> classmates for on <unk>
a <unk> game show has as its host a belgian <unk> to be italian
one of italy ' favorite shows fantastic a te variety show is so popular that viewers cl to buy a chocolate product ca fantastic whose <unk> were sung each week by dancing show even though the product did n exist
topping the cheese stunt on another typical evening of fun on wet das a <unk> won a bet with the show ' host thomas got that he could identify N german dialects over the telephone
a celebrity guest u ambassador to west germany richard burt also won a bet that someone could pile up N worth of quarters on a <unk> coin
mr burt nonetheless paid the penalty as if he had lost agreeing to spend a day with west german foreign minister hans gen fry and selling their combined weight in potato <unk>
if this seems like pretty weak stuff around which to raise the protection barriers it may be because these shows need all the protection they can get
european programs usually target only their own local audience and often only a small portion of that
mega in germany or italy rarely make it even to france or great britain and almost never show up on u screens
attempts to produce pan programs have generally resulted in disappointment
one annual co the three <unk> song contest featuring soft songs from each of N european countries has been described as the world ' most boring tv show
another je sans frontier where <unk> from ass european countries make fools of themselves performing <unk> tasks is a hit in france
a u imitation under the title almost anything goes flopped fast
for the most part what ' made here stays here and for good reason
the cream of the british crop the literary <unk> that are shown on u public television as masterpiece theater make up a relatively small part of british air time
most british programming is more of an acquired taste
there is for instance one man and his dog a herd contest among sheep dogs
also ri to the british are hours of dart <unk> even more hours of lawn bowling contests and still more hours of <unk> marathon
european drama has had better though still mixed fortunes
the most popular such shows focus on narrow national concerns
a french knock of dallas called chateau and set in a french vineyard had a good run in france which ended after the female lead was injured in a real auto accident
schwarz black forest clinic a kind of german st elsewhere set in a health spa is popular in germany and has spread into france
italy ' most popular series is a drama called la pi or the <unk> which chronicles the fight of an ideal young investigator in <unk> against the mafia
it was front news in italy earlier this year when the fictional inspector was gunn down in the series
spain ' most popular mini this year was jun the story of an aging bull
the trend is pretty well established now that local programs are the most popular with american programs second says brian wen a former director of programs for the british broadcasting corp
given a choice everybody will watch a home show
but frequently there is n much choice
thus europe has begun the recent crusade to produce more worthy shows of its own programs with broader appeal
we ' basically got to start from scratch to train writers and producers to make shows that other people will want to see con colin young head of britain ' national film theatre school
while some in the u contend that advertising is the <unk> of television here many believe that its absence is to blame for the european tv industry ' slug development
until recently national governments in europe controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising
since production costs were guaranteed it did n matter that a program could n be sold abroad or put into syndication as most american programs are
but not much money was spent on the shows either a situation that encouraged cheap talk and game shows while disco expensive <unk>
now however commercial channels are coming to most european countries and at the same time satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly
just last week greece authorized two commercial channels for the first time spain earlier began to allow commercial television alongside its state channels
the result is a new and huge appetite for programming
but perhaps to the con of those calling for quota most of this void is likely to be filled with the cheap and most pl programming now available re usually of shows made in the u
sky channel a british venture of australian press ty rupert murdoch offers what must be a ba cultural mix to most of its audience
the financially struggling station offers programs obviously made available cheap from its boss ' other ventures

british aerospace plc and france ' thomson s said they are nearing an agreement to merge their guided divisions greatly expanding collaboration between the two defense contractors
the N joint venture which may be dubbed euro would have combined annual sales of at least N billion N billion and would be among the world ' largest missile makers
after two years of talks plans for the venture are sufficiently advanced for the companies to seek french and british government clearance
the companies hope for a final agreement by year
the venture would strengthen the rapidly growing ties between the two companies and help make them a leading force in european defense contracting

just last week they announced they may make a joint bid to buy fe international signal plc a smaller british defense contractor rocked by alleged accounting fraud at a u unit
the sudden romance of british aerospace and thomson traditionally bitter competitors for middle east and third world weapons contracts is stirring controversy in western europe ' defense industry
most threatened by closer british aerospace ties would be their respective national rivals including mat s in france and britain ' general electric co plc
but neither mat nor ge unrelated to stamford con general electric co are sitting quietly by as their competitors join forces
yesterday a source close to ge confirmed that his company may join the fe fight as part of a possible consortium that would bid against british aerospace and thomson
companies with which ge has had talks about a possible joint fe bid include mat britain ' dow group plc west germany ' dai ag and france ' das group
but it may be weeks before ge and its potential partners decide whether to bid the source indicated
ge plans first to study fe ' financial accounts which auditor recently said included N million in <unk> contracts at a u unit international signal & control group with which fe merged last year
also any ge bid might be blocked by british anti regulators fe is ge ' main competitor on several key defense contracts and its purchase by ge may height british defense ministry worries about concentration in the country ' defense industry
a consortium bid however would dim ge ' direct role in fe and might consequently app ministry officials
a british aerospace spoke appeared un by the prospect of a fight with ge for fe competition is the name of the game she said
at least one potential ge partner mat insists it is n interested in fe
we have nothing to say about this affair which does n concern us a mat official said sunday
the missile venture the british aerospace spoke said is a needed response to the new environment in defense contracting
for both thomson and british aerospace earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight defense ministries and middle east sales a traditional main for both companies ' exports have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices
the venture ' importance for thomson is great
thomson feels the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other europeans

annual revenue of british aerospace ' missile business is about N million a thomson spokesman said
british aerospace ' chief missile products include its N family of rap surface missiles

canadian crude production averaged about N million barrels a day during N ' first half about N % below the N level
the capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas said ronald watkins vice president for government and industry relations with inter ' parent inter energy inc
mr watkins said volume on inter ' system is down about N % since january and is expected to fall further making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the N
there has been a swing of the <unk> back to the gas side he said
many of canada ' oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly
the number of active drilling rig in canada is down N % from a year ago and the number of completed oil wells is down more than that due to the increasing focus on gas exploration said robert <unk> manager of crude oil with calgary ' independent petroleum association of canada an industry group
mr watkins said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature conventional fields in western canada
inter transports about N % of all crude produced in western canada and almost N % of inter ' total volume consists of light crude
nearly all of the crude oil that canada exports to the u is transported on inter ' system whose main line runs from <unk> to major u and canadian cities in the great lakes region including chicago buffalo toronto and montreal
canada ' current oil exports to the u total about N barrels a day or about N % of net u crude imports said john li president of the new york petroleum industry research foundation
that ranks canada as the fourth source of imported crude behind saudi arabia <unk> and mexico
mr li said canada ' declining crude output combined with the fast output of u crude will help int u reliance on oil from overseas particularly the middle east
it ' very much a growing concern
but when something is inevitable you learn to live with it he said
mr li stressed that the delay of inter ' proposed expansion wo n by itself increase u dependence on offshore crude however since canadian imports are limited in any case by canada ' falling output
under terms of its proposed two expansion which would have required regulatory approval inter intended to add N barrels a day of additional capacity to its system beginning with a modest expansion by N
the system currently has a capacity of N million barrels a day
inland steel industries inc expects to report that third earnings dropped more than N % from the previous quarter as a result of reduced sales volume and increased costs
in the second quarter the steel had net income of N million or N a share including a pre charge of N million related to the settlement of a suit on sales of N billion
the company said normal seasonal softness and lost orders caused by prolonged labor talks reduced shipments by N tons in the latest quarter compared with the second quarter
at the same time the integrated business was hurt by continued increases in materials costs and repair and maintenance expenses as well as higher labor costs under its new contract
the service business was hurt by reduced margins and start costs associated with its joseph t rye & son unit
the company said it is beginning to see some shipping improvements in both the inter and steel segments which should result in improved results for the fourth quarter
inland said its third results will be announced later this week
in the year third quarter when the industry was in the midst of a boom the company had net of N million or N a share on sales of N billion
predicting the financial results of computer firms has been a tough job lately
take microsoft corp the largest maker of personal computer software and generally considered an industry bell
in july the company stunned wall street with the prediction that growth in the personal computer business overall would be only N % in N a modest increase when compared with the si expansion of years past
investors taking this as a sign that a broad industry slump was in the off reacted by selling the company ' stock which lost N that day to close at N in national over trading
but that was all of three months ago
last week microsoft said it expects revenue for its first quarter ended sept N to increase N %
the announcement caused the company ' stock to surge N to close at N a share
microsoft ' surprising strength is one example of the difficulty facing investors looking for re about the financial health of the computer firms
it ' hard to know what to expect at this point said peter rogers an analyst at robertson stephens & co
the industry def <unk>
to illustrate mr rogers said that of the N computer firms he follows half will report for their most recent quarter earnings below last year ' results and half above those results
among those companies expected to have a down quarter are he co am corp and sun micro inc generally solid performers in the past
international business machines corp also is expected to report disappointing results
apple computer inc meanwhile is expected to show improved earnings for the period ended sept
another contradictory message comes from business inc a computer retailer
in july the company reported that booming sales of new personal computers from apple and ibm had resulted in net income more than doubling for its fourth quarter ended june N to N million or N cents a share
this month however business warned investors that results for its first quarter ended sept N had n met expectations
the company said it expects earnings of N to N cents a share down from N cents a share in the year period
while the earnings picture confuse observers say the major forces expected to shape the industry in the coming year are clearer
companies will continue to war over standards
in computer publishing a battle over type is hurting adobe systems inc which sells software that controls the image produced by printers and displays
until recently adobe had a lock on the market for image software but last month apple adobe ' biggest customer and microsoft <unk>
now the two firms are collaborating on an alternative to adobe ' approach and analysts say they are likely to carry ibm the biggest seller of personal computers along with them
the short outlook for adobe ' business however appears strong
the company is beginning to ship a new software program that ' being herald as a boon for owners of low printers sold by apple
the program is aimed at improving the quality of printed material
john warn adobe ' chief executive officer said the mountain view cal company has been receiving N calls a day about the product since it was demonstrated at a computer publishing conference several weeks ago
meanwhile competition between various operating systems which control the basic functions of a computer spells trouble for software firms generally
it creates uncertainty and usually slow down sales said russ <unk> an analyst at sound financial group
mr <unk> said this probably is behind the expected weak performance of al corp maker of a widely used computer publishing program
he expects al to report earnings of N cents a share on revenues of N million for its third quarter compared with earnings of N cents a share on revenue of N million in the year period
al officials could n be reached for comment
on the other hand the battle of the bus is expected to grow increasingly irrelevant
a bus is the data highway within a computer
ibm is backing one type of bus called micro while the nine other leading computer makers including h and com computer corp have chosen another method
users do n care about the bus said daniel benton an analyst at goldman sachs & co
he said apple ' family of macintosh computers for instance uses four different buses and no one seems to mind
the gap between winners and la will grow
in personal computers apple com and ibm are expected to tighten their hold on their business
at the same time second firms will continue to lose ground
some la competitors even may leave the personal computer business altogether
w technology for instance is considered a candidate to sell its troubled operation
w has done well establishing a distribution business but they have n delivered products that sell said <unk> brown an analyst at pr securities
mr brown estimates w whose terminals business is strong will report a loss of N cents a share for its quarter ended sept
personal makers will continue to eat away at the business of more traditional computer firms
ever powerful desk computers designed with one or more micro as their brains are expected to increasingly take on functions carried out by more expensive mini and main
the guys that make traditional hardware are really being obsolete by micro machines said mr benton
as a result of this trend longtime powerhouse h ibm and digital equipment corp are scrambling to <unk> with micro systems of their own
but they will have to act quickly
mr benton expects com to un a family of high personal computers later this year that are powerful enough to serve as the hub for communications within large networks of desk machines
a raft of new computer companies also has targeted this <unk> market
population drain ends for midwest states
iowa is making a comeback
so are indiana ohio and michigan
the population of all four states is on the ups according to new census bureau estimates following declines throughout the early N
the gains to be sure are rather small
iowa for instance saw its population grow by N people or N % between N and N the census bureau says
still even that modest increase is good news for a state that had n grown at all since N
between N and N north dakota was the only state in the midwest to lose population a loss of N people
six of the N midwest states have been growing steadily since N illinois kansas minnesota missouri south dakota and wisconsin
the northeast has been holding its own in the population race
seven of nine states have grown each year since N including new york which lost N % of its population during the N
and although pennsylvania and massachusetts suffered slight declines earlier in the decade they are growing again
at the same time several states in the south and west have had their own population turn
seven states that grew in the early N are now losing population west virginia mississippi louisiana oklahoma montana wyoming and alaska
overall though the south and west still out the northeast and midwest and fast states like florida and california ensure that the pattern will continue
but the growth gap between the sun belt and other regions has clearly started narrowing
more elderly maintain their independence
thanks to modern medicine more couples are growing old together
and even after losing a spouse more of the elderly are staying independent
a new census bureau study of the non population shows that N % of people aged N to N were living with a spouse in N up from N % in N
this does n mean they ' less likely to live alone however
that share has remained at about N % since N
what has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouse rather than with other relatives such as children
in N N % of those aged N to N lived with relatives other than spouse down from N % in N
as people get even older many become <unk>
but even among those aged N and older the share living with a spouse rose slightly to N % in N from N % in N
like their younger counterparts the older elderly are less likely to live with other relatives
only N % of those aged N and older lived with relatives other than spouse in N down from N % in N
the likelihood of living alone beyond the age of N has increased to N % from N %
more people are remaining independent longer presumably because they are better off physically and financially
careers count most for the well
many affluent people place personal success and money above family
at least that ' what a survey by ernst & young and yank <unk> shu indicates
two of respondents said they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs while fewer than half said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families
being successful in careers and spending the money they make are top priorities for this group
unlike most studies of the affluent market this survey excluded the super
average household income for the sample was N and average net assets were reported as N
the goal was to learn about one of today ' fastest income groups the upper class
although they represent only N % of the population they control nearly one of discretion income
across the board these consumers value quality buy what they like rather than just what they need and appreciate products that are distinctive
despite their considerable incomes and assets N % of the respondents in the study do n feel financially secure and one do n feel that they have made it
twenty percent do n even feel they are financially well off
many of the affluent are n comfortable with themselves either
about N % do n feel they ' more able than others
while two feel some guilt about being affluent only N % give N or more to charity each year
thirty percent attend religious services regularly at the same time N % feel that in life one sometimes has to compromise one ' principles
odds and ends
the number of women and minorities who hold jobs in top management in the nation ' largest banks has more than doubled since N

this small dallas suburb ' got trouble
trouble with a capital t and that <unk> with p and that stands for pool
more than N years ago prof harold hill the con man in meredith <unk> ' the music man warned the citizens of river city iowa against the game
now kind spirits on addison ' town council have barred the town ' fan hotel the grand kemp from installing three free pool tables in its new lounge
mayor lynn sp and two members of the council said they were worried about setting a precedent that would permit pool halls along addison ' main street
and the mayor in an ad that bears a rhythmic resemblance to prof hill ' warned that alcohol leads to betting which leads to fights
the council ' action is yet another blow to a sport that its fans claim has been mali un for years
obviously they ' not in touch with what ' going on says tom <unk> vice president of the national pocket bill association
pool is hot in new york and chicago he insists where upscale suit places are adding tables
with today ' tough drunk driving laws he adds people do n want to just sit around and drink
besides row behavior seems unlikely at the grand kemp where rooms average N a night and the cheap mixed drinks go for N a pop
at the lounge manager elizabeth <unk> wo n admit <unk> in jeans t or tennis shoes
but a majority of the addison council did n buy those arguments
introducing pool argued council riley rein would be dangerous
it would open a can of worms
addison is no stranger to cans of worms either
after its previous mayor committed suicide last year an investigation disclosed that town officials regularly voted on their own projects gave special favors to developer friends and dipped into the town ' co for trips and retreat

the only thing robert goldberg could praise about cbs ' new show island son leisure & arts sept N was the local color unfortunately neither he nor the producers of the show have done their homework

of all the ethnic tensions in america which is the most troubles right now
a good bet would be the tension between blacks and jews in new york city
or so it must seem to jackie mason the veteran jewish comedian appearing in a new abc sitcom airing on tuesday nights N p ed
not only is mr mason the star of chicken soup he ' also the inherit of a comedic tradition dating back to duck soup and he ' currently a man in hot water
here in neutral language is the gi of mr mason ' remarks quoted first in the village voice while he was a paid spokesman for the rudolph gi mayoral campaign and then in newsweek after he and the campaign <unk> company
mr mason said that many jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks so they support black candidates un
he said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination so they too support black candidates un
he said that jews have contributed more to black causes over the years than vice <unk>
of course mr mason did not use neutral language
as a <unk> of ethnic humor from the old days on the bo belt live television and the nightclub circuit mr mason <unk> reached for the <unk>
he said jews were sick with complexes and he called david din mr gi ' black opponent a fancy sh with a <unk>
if mr mason had used less der language to art his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow new yorker would the water be quite so hot
it probably would because few or none of the people upset by mr mason ' remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language
in addition some of mr mason ' critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism
for example the new york state counsel for the <unk> said that mr mason is like a dinosaur
people are fast leaving the place where he is stuck
these critics fail to distinguish between the type of ethnic humor that aims at di another group such as polish jokes and the type that is double aiming <unk> as well as outward
the latter typically is the humor of the under and it was perfect by both blacks and jews on the min and <unk> stage as a means of <unk> their white and gen audiences along with themselves
in the hands of a ze like lenny bruce this double <unk> could cut both the self and the audience to ribbons
but wi by a pro like jackie mason it is a constructive form of mischief
why constructive
because despite all the media pratt about comedy and politics not <unk> they are similar in one respect both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and <unk> the co of groups in conflict
that ' why it ' dangerous to have well thought police on college campuses and elsewhere taboo all critical mention of group differences
as elizabeth kris wrote in the new york times just before the mason don perhaps into would not <unk> over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to sim
the question is if group conflicts still exist as und they do and if mr mason ' type of ethnic humor is pass then what other means do we have for letting off steam
do n say the tv sitcom because that happens to be a <unk> that in its desperate need to attract everybody and off nobody resembles politics more than it does comedy
it is true that the best sitcom do allow group differences to sim yu vs blue boston in cheers children vs adults in the co show
but these are not the differences that make headlines
in chicken soup mr mason plays jackie a jewish <unk> court <unk> lynn red an irish widow and mother of three against the wishes of his mother rita <unk> and her brother michael <unk> mag
it ' worth noting that both di relatives are immigrants
at least they both speak with strong <unk> as do jackie and <unk>
it could n be more obvious that chicken soup is being made from an old recipe
and a safe one imagine if the romance in question were between an orthodox <unk> and a member of the nation of <unk>
back in the N the play and movie versions of ab ' irish rose made the theme of <unk> between the ass offspring of jewish and irish immigrants so popular that its author anne nichols lost a pl suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public domain
and it has remained there as evidenced by its re in a N cbs sitcom called <unk> loves <unk> whose sole distinction was that it led to the real marriage of meredith baxter and david bi
clearly the question with chicken soup is not whether the pot will <unk> over but whether it will sim at all
so far the <unk> have been few and far between
part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcom ever since the did days of norman <unk> to <unk> about social issues
to some extent this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to en us about ethnic <unk> by rev them
for instance michael dislike jackie not because he ' a sh jewish businessman but because he quit his well job as a salesman in order to become a social worker
even more problematic is the inc between sitcom <unk> and mr mason ' comic persona
the best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end and occasionally in the middle when mr mason slips into his stand mode and starts met out that old jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself
but too often these <unk> lack spark because this sitcom like all sitcom is tim about confronting mr mason ' stock in trade ethnic differences
i ' not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the catholic dispute over the <unk> convent at <unk>
that issue like racial tensions in new york city will have to cool down not heat up before it can sim
but i am suggesting that they stop requiring mr mason to <unk> his classic sh with some line about caring for other people that would sound sh on the lips of miss america
at your age jackie you ought to know that you ca n make soup without turning up the flame

the senate ' decision to approve a bare deficit bill without a capital tax cut still leaves open the possibility of en a gains tax reduction this year
late friday night the senate voted N to approve an estimated N billion measure that had been stripped of hundreds of provisions that would have widened rather than narrowed the federal budget deficit
law drastically <unk> the bill to blunt criticism that it was b with special tax breaks and spending increases
we ' putting a deficit bill back in the category of being a deficit bill said senate budget committee chairman james sas d ten
but senate supporters of the trim legislation said that other bills would soon be moving through congress that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside including a capital tax cut
in addition the companion deficit bill already passed by the house includes a capital provision
house negotiations are likely to begin at mid and last for a while
no one can predict exactly what will happen on the house side said senate minority leader robert do r kan
but he added i believe republicans and democrats will work together to get capital reform this year
white house budget director richard dar told reporters yesterday that the administration would n push to keep the capital cut in the final version of the bill
we do n need this as a way to get capital gains he said
house budget committee chairman leon pan d cal said in an interview if that ' the signal that comes from the white house that will help a great deal
the senate ' decision was a set for president bush and will make approval of a capital tax cut less certain this year
opponents of the cut are playing hard
senate majority leader george mitchell d maine said he was confident that any house agreement on the deficit legislation would n include a capital tax cut
and a senior aide to the house ways and means committee where tax legislation <unk> said there are n any plans to produce another tax bill that could carry a gains tax cut this year
one obvious place to attach a capital tax cut and perhaps other popular items stripped from the deficit bill is the legislation to raise the federal borrowing limit
such legislation must be enacted by the end of the month
the senate bill was par back in an attempt to speed deficit through congress
because the legislation has n been completed president bush has until midnight tonight to en across spending cuts mandated by the gram deficit law
senators hope that the need to avoid those cuts will pressure the house to agree to the <unk> bill
the house appears reluctant to join the senators
a key is whether house republicans are willing to ac to their senate colleagues ' decision to drop many pet provisions
although i am encouraged by the senate action said chairman dan ro d ill of the house ways and means committee it is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved in the <unk> conference with the senate
another big question hovering over the debate is what president bush thinks
he has been resisting a stripped bill without a guaranteed vote on his capital tax cut
but republican senators saw no way to overcome a procedural hurdle and garner the N votes needed to win the capital issue on the floor so they went ahead with the <unk> bill
the senate bill was stripped of many popular though revenue provisions a number of which are included in the house bill
these include a child initiative and extensions of soon tax breaks for low housing and research expenditures
also missing from the senate bill is the house ' repeal of a law called section N that com companies to give rank workers comparable health benefits to top paid executives
one high provision that was originally in the senate bill but was cut out because it lost money was the proposal by chairman lloyd bent d texas of the senate finance committee to expand the de for individual retirement accounts
mr bent said he hopes the senate will consider that measure soon
to the delight of some doctors the bill dropped a plan passed by the finance committee that would have overhaul the entire physician system under medicare
to the det of many low people efforts to boost med funding especially in rural areas also were stricken
asked why senators were giving up so much new mexico sen pete dome the ranking republican on the senate budget committee said we ' looking like <unk>
things had just gone too far
sen do said that the move required sacrifice by every senator
it worked others said because there were no exceptions all revenue provisions were stricken
the senate also dropped a plan by its finance committee that would have increased the income threshold beyond which senior citizens have their social security benefits reduced
in addition the bill dropped a plan to make permanent a N % ex tax on long telephone calls
it no longer includes a plan that would have <unk> what remains of the completed method of accounting which is used by military contractors to reduce their tax burden
it also drops a provision that would have permitted corporations to use excess pension funds to pay health benefits for current retire
also stricken was a five increase in the maximum occupational safety and health administration penalties which would have raised N million in fiscal N
a provision that would have made the social security administration an independent agency was ex
the approval of the senate bill was especially sweet for sen mitchell who had proposed the stream
mr mitchell ' relations with budget director dar who pushed for a capital cut to be added to the measure have been strained since mr dar chose to bypass the maine democrat and deal with other law earlier this year during a dispute over drug funding in the fiscal N supplemental spending bill
the deficit reduction bill contains N billion in tax increases in fiscal N and N billion over five years

joseph granville
i ' the only one who said there would be an october massacre all through late august and september says mr granville once a widely followed market guru and still a well newsletter writer
everyone will tell you that this time is different from N he says
well in some ways it is different but technically it is just the same
if you ' a <unk> you <unk> the signals
right now they ' telling me to get the hell out and stay out
i see no major support until N
i see a possibility of going to N this month
mr granville says he would n even think of buying until at least N to N stocks have hit N low about N stocks hit new low friday
most people he says have no idea what a massacre pattern looks like
<unk> ga
a quantitative analyst with shear lehman hutton inc ms ga had warned clients to take their money out of the market before the N crash
friday ' big drop she says was not a crash
this was an october massacre like those that occurred in N and N
now as in those two years her stock market indicators are positive
so she thinks the damage will be short and contained
those corrections lasted one to four weeks and took the market N % down she says
this is exactly the same thing as far as i ' concerned
thus she says if the dow jones industrial average dropped below N it would just be a flu
my advice is to buy
as she calculate it the average stock now sells for about N times companies ' earnings
she says that ratio could climb to N given current interest rates and still be within the range of fair value
ned davis
friday ' fall marks the start of a bear market says mr davis president of ned davis research inc
but mr davis whose views are widely respected by money managers says he expects no N crash
there was a unique combination in N he says
margin debt was at a record high
there was tremendous public enthusiasm for stock mutual funds
the main thing was portfolio insurance a mechanical trading system intended to protect an investor against losses
a hundred billion dollars in stock was subject to it
in N such selling contributed to a snow effect
today could even be an up day mr davis says if major broker firms agree to refrain from program trading
over the next several months though he says things look bad
i think the market will be heading down into november he says
we will probably have a year rally and then go down again
sort of a two bear market
he expects the down to carry the dow jones industrial average down to around N sometime next year
that would be a normal bear market he says
i guess that ' my forecast
leon g cooper
i do n think the market is going through another october N
i do n think that ' the case at all says mr cooper a partner at goldman sachs & co and chairman of goldman sachs asset management
mr cooper sees this as a good time to pick up bargain but he does n think there ' any need to rush
i expect the market to open weaker monday but then it should find some stability
he tick off several major differences between now and two years ago
unlike N interest rates have been falling this year
unlike N the dollar has been strong
and unlike N the economy does n appear to be in any danger of over
but the economy ' slower growth this year also means the outlook for corporate profits is n good he says
so it ' a very mixed bag
thus he concludes this is not a good environment to be fully invested in stocks
if i had come into friday on margin or with very little cash in the portfolio i would not do any buying
but we came into friday with a conservative portfolio so i would look to do some modest buying on behalf of clients
we ' going to look for some of the better companies that got clock friday
john kenneth gal
this is the latest <unk> of the capacity of the financial community for rec <unk> says mr gal an economist
i see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion he says
the explosion of junk bonds and takeover has <unk> a lot of ins securities in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations that are the objects of takeover or feared takeover with huge amounts of debt rather than equity
this has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable
nevertheless he says a depression does n appear likely
there is more res in the economy at large than we commonly suppose he says
it takes more error now to have a major depression than back in the <unk> much as the financial community and the government may try
mario gabe
new york money manager mario gabe an expert at spotting takeover candidates says that takeover are n totally gone
companies are still going to buy companies around the world he says
examples are ford looking at jaguar bells looking at lin broadcasting
these sorts of takeover do n require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them so mr gabe figures they will continue
the market was up N % since president bush took office mr gabe says so a correction was to be expected
he thinks another crash is unlikely and says he was ni at selected stocks during friday ' plunge
stocks that were thrown out just on an emotional basis are a great opportunity this week for guys like me he says
jim rogers
it seems to me that this is the pin that has finally prick the balloon says mr rogers a professor of finance at columbia university and former co of one of the most successful hedge funds in history quantum fund
he sees economic problems financial problems ahead for the u with a fairly strong possibility of a recession
friday you could n sell dollars he says
dealers would give you a quote but then refuse to make the trade
if the dollar stays weak he says that will add to inflation pressures in the u and make it hard for the federal reserve board to ease interest rates very much
mr rogers wo n decide what to do today until he sees how the london and tokyo markets go
he recommends that investors sell takeover stocks but hang on to some other stocks especially utilities which often do well during periods of economic weakness
frank cu
many people now claim to have predicted the N crash
queens newsletter writer francis x cu actually did it he stated in writing in september N that the dow jones industrial average was likely to decline about N points the following month
mr cu says what happens now will depend a good deal on the federal reserve board
if it promptly cuts the discount rate it charges on loans to banks he says that could quiet things down
if not we could go to N very soon
frank w terri
stock prices would still have to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks says mr terri president and managing director of renaissance investment management inc in cincinnati
renaissance which manages about N billion drew stiff criticism from many clients earlier this year because it pulled entirely out of stocks at the beginning of the year and thus missed a strong rally
renaissance is keeping its money entirely in cash equivalent primarily u treasury bills
t probably are the right place to be he says
regarding the oct N letter to the editor from rep tom lan chairman of the house subcommittee on employment and housing alleging
N that your sept N editorial <unk> committees was factual inaccurate and deliberately misleading
i thought your editorial was factual accurate and deliberately el
N that mr lan supported the rights of the witnesses to take the fifth amendment
yes he did
as i watched him on c i heard him speak those lovely words about the bill of rights which he quotes from the transcript of the hearings
he did repeat those nice pl several times as an indication of his support for the constitution
he used about N words defending the witnesses ' constitutional rights
unfortunately by my rough guess he used better than N words heap sc on the witnesses for exercising the fifth
he sandwich his praise of constitutional meat between large lo of bi commentary
as your editorial right pointed out samuel pierce former hu secretary and lance wilson mr pierce ' former aide are currently being held up to sc for taking the fifth amendment
that certainly is not the supposed distorted reading indicated by mr lan
N that his committee does not deal with any possible criminal activity at hu
my colleagues and i fully realize we are not a court etc
absolute <unk>
by any reasonable man <unk> mr lan and his colleagues have a whole bunch of people tried and convicted
apparently their verdict is in
right now they ' pursuing evidence
that ' not a bad way to proceed just somewhat different from standard american practice
how was that practice referred to when i was in school
ah yes something called a star chamber
of course mr lan dot protest that his subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative change
no doubt that ' partially true
everything that mr lan says in his letter is partially true
he ' right about his subcommittee ' responsibilities when it comes to obtaining information from prior hu officials
but if his explanation of motivation is true why is his investigation so oriented as to identify criminal activity
why not simply questions designed to identify sources and causes of waste and in
such as what happened when congress wanted to know about N toilet seats or whatever they supposedly cost
no mr lan ' complaints simply wo n wash
N that the journal defend the sl fraud waste em influence and abuse of the public that took place while mr pierce was secretary of hu etc and so forth
no to my mind the journal did not defend sl fraud waste em influence and abuse of the public trust
it defended appropriate constitutional safeguard and practical common sense
the problem which the journal so right pointed out in a number of articles is not the likes of mr lan who after all is really a bit player on the stage but the attempt by congress to enhance itself into a quasi body
of course we ' also got a judiciary that seeks the same objective
the system is the problem not an individual member
individuals can always have their hands slapped
it ' when such <unk> does n occur that we ' got trouble
i do not by any means defend hu management
but i think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to american notions of liberty and freedom than any inc and yes maybe criminal within hu could possibly generate
the last time i saw a similar congressional hearing was when tail <unk> joe mccarthy did his work
raymond <unk>
par n
i disagree with the statement by mr lan that one should not draw an adverse inference against former hu officials who assert their fifth amendment privilege against self in congressional hearings
the fifth amendment states in relevant part that no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself
this privilege against self pre the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify
thus in a criminal case a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant ' failure to testify nor can the defendant be compelled to take the stand as a witness thus forcing him to take the fifth
the privilege however has been limited in <unk> with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only
the supreme court and some states have specifically recognized that the fifth amendment does not pre the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause
baxter v palm N u N N
thus in a civil case a defendant may be called as a witness he may be forced to testify or take the fifth and his taking of the fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter
he may take the fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and just belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution
allowing the defendant to take the fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one ' testimony harm him in the civil matter but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutional used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution
absent the risk of such prosecution a court may order the defendant to testify
thus when mr pierce asserted the fifth in a non proceeding particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel one must conclude that he held a good just belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution
the subcommittee congress and the american public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to con with mr pierce ' own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime
drawing the adverse inference in a non congressional hearing does not off the fifth amendment shield against self

este park col
it was friday the N and the stock market plum nearly N points
just a coincidence
or is tri fear of the number N justified
in academia a so friday the N effect has been set up and shot down by different professors
robert ko and <unk> <unk> professors of finance at the university of miami found evidence that the market is sp by friday the N
but their study which <unk> the N period has since been shown to be jin by an un choice of data
in the N the market took falls nine times in a row on friday the you
but the date tends to be a plus not a minus for stocks according to yale hirsch a collector of stock market lore
another study found that the N fridays the N in the N period had higher than average returns higher even than fridays in general which tend to be strong days for stock prices
on the only other friday the N this year the dow jones industrial average rose about four points
professor ko says the original study titled friday the N part <unk> was published tongue
in a similar <unk> he adds that the anniversary of the N crash and saturday ' full moon could have played a part too in friday ' market activity
reminiscent of those during the N crash that as stock prices plum and trading activity <unk> some phone calls to market makers in over stocks went una
we could n get dealers to answer their phones said robert king senior vice president of ot trading at robinson co in atlanta
it was like the friday before black monday two years ago
whether una phone calls had any effect or not nas stocks sank far less than those on the new york and american exchanges
nonetheless the nas composite index suffered its biggest point decline of the year and its sixth worst ever diving N or N % to N
ten points of the drop occurred during the last N minutes of trading
by comparison the new york stock exchange composite tumbled N % friday and the american stock exchange composite fell N %
on oct N N the nas composite fell N points or N % followed by its devastating N or N % slide three days later
nas volume friday totaled N million shares which was only the fifth busiest day so far this year
the single record of N million shares was set on oct N
there was n a lot of volume because it was just impossible to get stock moved said e buzz ge president of her he ge a new york company that makes markets in thousands of ot issues
most of the complaints about una phone calls came from regional broker rather than individual investors
mr king of robinson and others were quick to add that they believe the problem stemmed more from traders ' inability to handle the volume of calls rather than a deliberate attempt to avoid making trades
the subject is a sore one for nas and its market companies which were widely criticized two years ago following complaints from investors who could n reach their broker or trade in the chaos of the crash
peter da head of retail equity trading at shear lehman hutton declared it was the last hour of trading on a friday
there were too many phones ringing and too many things happening to expect market makers to be as efficient as robots
it was n intentional we were all busy
james <unk> head of ot trading at ham & qui in san francisco said it was just like two years ago
everybody was trying to do the same thing at the same time
<unk> mu the ot trading chief at dean wit reynolds in new york said proudly that his company executed every order it received by the close of trading
but he added you can only take one call at a time
market makers keep supplies of stock on hand to maintain orderly trading when im occur
on days like friday that means they must buy shares from sellers when no one else is willing to
when selling is so fr prices fall steep and fast
two years ago faced with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their inventor market makers themselves began dumping shares ex the slide in ot stock prices
on friday some market makers were selling again traders said
but with profits sa on wall street since the crash companies have kept smaller share stock on hand
mr <unk> of ham & qui said some prices fell without trades taking place as market makers kept dropping the prices at which they would buy shares
everyone was hitting everyone else ' bid he said
so while ot companies incurred losses on friday trading officials said the damage was n as bad as it was in N
two years ago we were carrying huge inventor and that was the big cu
i do n know of anyone carrying big inventor now said mr king of robinson
tony ce head of equity trading at piper ja & hop in minneapolis said that piper ja actually made money on friday
it helped that his inventory is a third smaller now than it was two years ago he said
joseph hard president of the national association of securities dealers which oversees the nas computer trading system said that despite the rush of selling he never considered the situation an emergency
the pace of trading was orderly he said
nas ' small order execution system worked <unk> as did the automated system for larger trades according to mr hard
nevertheless the shock of another steep plunge in stock prices undoubtedly will shake many investors ' confidence
in the past the ot market thrive on a firm base of small participation
because nas ' trading volume has n returned to pre levels traders and ot market officials hope the damage wo n be permanent
but they are worried
we were just starting to get the public ' confidence back lame mr mu of dean wit
more tr is the prospect that the overall collapse in stock prices could permanently er the base of small support the ot market was struggling to rebuild in the wake of the october N crash
mr ce of piper ja says some action from government policy makers would alla investor fears
it wo n take much more to scare the hell out of retail investors he says
the sellers on friday came from all corners of the ot market big and small institutional investors as well as individual investors and market makers
but grateful traders said the sell orders generally ranged from N shares to N shares compared with blocks of N shares or more two years ago
shear ' mr da said retail investors nervously sold stock friday and never returned to bargain
institutional investors which had been selling stock throughout last week to lock in handsome gains made through the third quarter were calm
we had a good amount of selling from institutions but not as much panic mr da said
if they could n sell some of them put the shares back on the shelf
in addition he said some bigger institutional investors placed bids to buy some ot stocks whose prices were beaten down
in addition mr da said computer program selling of ot stocks in the russell index of N small stocks and the standard & poor ' N index sent occasional waves through the market
nas ' biggest stocks were hammered
the nas N index of the largest non issues including the big ot technology issues tumbled N % or N to N
the nas financial index of giant insurance and banking stocks dropped N % or N to N
the ot market has only a handful of takeover stocks
but they fell sharply
mcc cellular communications for instance has offered to buy lin broadcasting as well as metro ' new york city cellular telephone interests and in a separate transaction sell certain mcc properties to con cellular

pension funds ins and other be of the investing world said they began scoop up stocks during friday ' market ro
and they plan to buy more today
right or wrongly many giant institutional investors appear to be fighting the latest war by applying the lesson they learned in the october N crash buying at the bottom pays off
to be sure big investors might put away their check in a hurry if stocks open sharply lower today
they could still panic and bail out of the market
but their N performance indicates that they wo n abandon stocks unless conditions get far worse
last time we got rewarded for going out and buying stocks when the panic was the worst said john w rogers president of chicago <unk> capital management inc which manages N billion of stocks
mr rogers spent half his cash on hand friday for our favorite stocks that have fallen apart
he expects to invest the rest if the market weaken further
denver portfolio manager james craig was n da when friday ' ro shaved N million from the value of the N million jan fund he oversees
i waited to make sure all the program trades had kicked through he said
then he jumped into the market
i spent N million in the last half
other money managers also opened their wallet
i was buying at the close friday and i ' be buying again because i know we ' getting good value said frederick a moran president of moran asset management inc greenwich con
there is no justification on the fundamental level for this crash
unlike mutual funds which can be forced to sell stock when investors rush to withdraw money big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market storms without jett stock
most often they do just that because stocks have proved to be the best long investment attracting about N trillion from pension funds alone
if you bought after the crash you did very very well off the bottom said stephen b timbers chief investment officer of chicago kemp financial services inc
the N billion california public employees retirement system for one added N billion to its stock portfolio two years ago
the last crash taught institutional investors that they have to be long holders and that they ca n react to short events good or bad said stephen l nes senior vice president for the pension consultants wil associates in santa monica cal
those that pulled out of stocks <unk> it he said so i doubt you ' see any significant changes in institutional portfolio as a result of friday ' decline
stocks as measured by the standard & poor ' N index have been stellar performers this year rising N % before friday ' plunge excluding divide
even friday ' slump leaves investors ahead more than N % well above the annual average for stocks over several decades
you could go down N points and still have a good year in the market said james d aw president of new york b capital corp
mr aw however worries that the market could go down N or N points in the next few days
it can happen before you can turn around
he said he disc many parallels with N including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the re of computer program trading
the only thing you do n have he said is the portfolio insurance phenomenon over on the rest
most institutional investors have abandoned the portfolio insurance he technique which is widely thought to have worsened the N crash
not really insurance this tactic was designed to soft the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offset profit by selling waves of s futures contracts
in its severe test the N billion of portfolio insurance in effect in the N crash did n work as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became <unk>
even without portfolio insurance market conditions were grim friday money managers said
neil wei whose new york chi capital partners had converted N % of its N million investment pool to cash in recent months said he was besieged by wall street firms friday asking him to take stock off their hands
we got calls from big block houses asking us if we want to make bids on anything said mr wei who happy with his returns on investments chalk up earlier declined the offers
mr wei predict stocks will appear to stabilize in the next few days before declining again trapping more investors
i think it will be a rig mort rally he said
meanwhile friday brought a rep for money managers whose investment styles had put them at odds with the market rally
especially glee were the short sellers who have been <unk> by this year ' market climb
the shorts sell borrowed shares hoping to profit by replacing them later at a lower price
the nation ' largest short operation is fe brothers palo alto cal which said last may that its short positions had shown losses of N % for the year up to that point
all that now has changed
we ' ahead for the year because of friday said the firm ' kurt fe
we ' not making a killing but we had a good day
food and drug administration spokesman jeff nes said the agency has turned over evidence in a criminal investigation concerning <unk> pharmaceuticals inc to the u attorney ' office in baltimore
neither <unk> nor any of the springfield gardens n company ' officials or employees have been charged with any crimes
<unk> won approval to market a version of a blood pressure medicine but acknowledged that it substituted a smith beech plc product as its own in tests
mr nes also said the fda has asked bo pharmaceutical co to recall at the retail level its ur tract anti
but so far the company has n complied with that request the spokesman said
bo the subject of a criminal investigation by the fda and the inspector general ' office of the health and human services department only agreed to recall two strengths of its version of macro as far down as direct customers mostly wholesale mr nes said
bo of cop n earlier began a voluntary recall of both its N mill and N mill versions of the drug
the fda has said it presented evidence it uncovered to the company indicating that bo substituted the brand product for its own to gain government approval to sell generic versions of macro
bo has denied that it switched the brand product for its own in such testing
the west german retailer ask deutsche ka ag plans to challenge the legal of a widely employed anti defense of companies in the netherlands
the eventual court decision could become a landmark in dutch corporate law because the lawsuit ask plans to file would be the first to challenge the entire principle and practice of companies issuing voting preferred shares to management trusts to dil voting power of common stock
up to now only specific aspects of these defenses have been challenged though unsuccessfully ask ' dutch lawyers noted
should the courts uphold the validity of this type of defense ask will then ask the court to over such a vote maneuver recently deployed by ko ah n
ask says the dutch international food retailer had n reasonable grounds to issue preferred stock to a friendly trust and thus dil the worth and voting power of ask and other shareholders
speaking through its dutch lawyers ask also disclosed it holds a N % stake in ah
it was previously thought ask held a N % stake that was accumulated since july
a spokesman for ah said his company is confident of its own position and the prop of the preferred issue
he termed ask ' legal actions as un to international cooperation among european retailers
chase manhattan bank chairman willard butcher is a conservative banker and a loyal republican but on friday morning he had few kind words for president bush ' economic policy
there are some very significant issues out there such as the fiscal deficit the trade deficit our relations with japan that have to be the subject of major initiatives he said in an interview
i ' like to see that initiative and i have n
there is n a big shot an agenda
a few hours later the stock market dropped N points
politicians tried to finger each other for the blame although many analysts doubt that washington was sing responsible for wall street ' wo
but mr butcher ' comments make one thing clear some on wall street wonder if anyone is in charge of economic policy
consider this
by N p tonight president bush must order N billion of automatic across cuts in government spending to comply with the gram budget law
the cuts are necessary because congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a deficit bill
we simply do n have strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and make tough choices house budget committee chairman leon pan d cal said yesterday on nbc news ' meet the press
for the last two weeks the bush administration and the federal reserve have been engaged in a semi battle over international economic policy
the administration has been trying to push the dollar lower the fed has been resisting
one of the things that continues to worry me is this monetary warfare between the treasury department and the federal reserve board said lawrence ku a bear ste & co economist on abc ' this week
the administration has sent out confusing signals about its response to a recent spat of airline takeover
last month transportation secretary sam skinner forced northwest airlines to reduce a stake held by k royal dutch airlines
but he has since run into opposition from the treasury and the white house over that decision
and he has kept <unk> on how his decision might affect a bid for united airlines which includes a big stake by british airways plc
some analysts say uncertainty about washington ' anti policy was one reason that financing for the united airlines takeover fell through the event that triggered the market drop
in many ways the backdrop to friday ' stock decline is ee similar to that of october N ' N crash
then as now the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold
the treasury was locked in a battle over international economic policy although at that time it was with west german officials rather than the federal reserve
and concern about official actions aimed at takeover then by the tax house ways and means committee rather than the transportation department were making markets nervous
the N crash brought the reagan administration and democratic law to the table for the first budget summit resulting in a two plan to reduce the deficit by more than N billion even though the deficit actually rose by nearly N billion during that period
but barr further drops in the market this week a similar outcome does n seem likely this year
law and administration officials agree that friday ' drop by itself is n enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit agreement that would be more serious and more far than last spring ' gi plan which still is n fully implemented
one of the biggest reasons that new talks are n likely to come about is that as everyone learned in N the economy and the market can survive a one N tumble
everybody thought we were looking at a <unk> of N that we were looking at a recession rep pan said yesterday in an interview
that did not happen
they learned they could survive it without much problem
but administration officials privately agree with mr pan who said a pre drop this week is going to force the president and congress to take a much harder look at fiscal policy
in that case there will be plenty of blame to go around
there is an underlying concern on the part of the american people and there should be that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut said senate finance committee chairman lloyd bent d texas
nevertheless it clearly will take more than friday ' N decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between law and white house budget director richard dar over the capital fight
hill democrats are particularly angry over mr bush ' claim that the capital cut was part of april ' budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit legislation
there is no prospect of any so grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply did n live up to this year ' deal senate majority leader george mitchell d maine said yesterday on cbs news ' face the nation
during last week ' maneuver on the deficit bill and the capital issue there were signs that senate republicans and the administration were at odds
at the very moment that senate republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit legislation white house spokesman mar fitz told reporters that it was the president ' policy to include it
when an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation oregon sen bob pack the ranking go member of the tax senate finance committee hailed it
asked if the administration agreed he curt replied the ad will have to speak for itself
friday ' market tumble could spur action on rec the house and senate versions of the deficit measure a process that is n expected to begin until tomorrow at the soon
senate republicans expressed the hope that the house would follow the lead of the senate which on friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal N deficit
the market needs a strong signal that we ' serious about deficit reduction and the best way to do that is for the house of representatives to strip their bill of similar provisions sen warren ru r n said yesterday
the white house office of management and budget whose calculations determine whether the gram targets are met estimated that the house deficit measure would cut the fiscal N short by N billion almost half of the congressional budget office ' estimate of N billion
rep pan said that om ' figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across cuts but added we ' getting very close to the margins here
no one in washington was willing to take the blame for pro friday ' drop in the stock market
but some players were quick to seize the moment
before the sun had set on friday richard ra the supply chief economist of the u chamber of commerce issued a statement at the drop in stock prices to the senate decision to post action on capital gains
investors who had been holding assets in anticipation of a more favorable time to sell were sp he said
there have been many prep reasons advanced to support a capital tax cut sen mitchell said during his television appearance but i suggest that is perhaps more than any of the others

small investors matched their big institutional brethren in anxiety over the weekend but most seemed to be taking a philosophical approach and said they were resigned to riding out the latest storm in the stock market
i ' not losing faith in the market said boston lawyer christopher sullivan as he watched the market plunge on a big screen in front of a broker firm
but he ' not so sure about everyone else
i think on monday the small investors are going to panic and sell predicted mr sullivan whose investments include am corp ' american airlines unit and several mutual funds

at the annual congress of the national association of investors corp at the h <unk> hotel in minneapolis the scene was calm
some N investors representing investor clubs from around the u were attending when the market started to slide friday
but robert show an official of the association said no special bulletin or emergency meetings of the investors ' clubs are planned
in fact some of the association ' members long buy investors welcomed the drop in prices
we hope to take advantage of it said john snyder a member of a los angeles investors ' club
he has four stocks in mind to buy if the prices drop to the level he wants
not everyone is reacting so <unk> however and many wonder about the long implications of what is widely viewed as the cause of friday ' slide reluctance by banks to provide financing for a buy of ua corp parent of united airlines
marc <unk> a tampa fl investment banker said the market drop is one of a tremendous number of signs that the leverage take era is ending
there ' no question that there ' a general di for leverage among lend
mr <unk> believes however that the market could be stabilized if california investor marvin davis steps back in to the united bidding with an offer of N a share
sara albert a N dallas law student says she ' generally ski about the stock market and the takeover activity that seems to fuel it
i have this feeling that it ' built on sand she says that the market rises but there ' no foundation to it
she and her husband pulled most of their investments out of the market after the N crash although she still owns some tex stock
partly because of concern about the economy and partly because she recently quit her job as a legal assistant to go to school i think at this point we want to be a lot more liquid
others wonder how many more of these shocks the small investor can stand
we all assumed october N was a one shot said san francisco attorney david greenberg
we told the little guy it could only happen once in a lifetime come on back

the crowded field for notebook computers is about to become a lot more crowded
com computer corp ' long entry today into the notebook field is expected to put immediate heat on others in the market especially zenith electronics corp the current market leader and on a <unk> of promising start
com ' series of notebook extends a trend toward downs in the personal computer market
one manufacturer already has produced a clip computer called a note and two others have introduced even smaller palm
but those machines are still considered novel with <unk> only a mu could love and screens to match
com ' notebook by contrast may be the first in their weight class not to ski on features found in much bigger machines
analysts say they ' faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market and they ' priced aggressively at N to N
all of this comes in a machine that weighs only six pounds and fits comfortably into most briefcase
in recent months com ' competition including zenith to corp tan corp and nec corp all have introduced portable that weigh approximately the same and that are called notebook perhaps misleading
one analyst noting that most such machines are about two inches thick takes exception to the name
this is n quite a notebook i call it a phone he says
that ca n be said of the N note computer introduced a few weeks ago by grid systems corp a unit of tan
instead of a keyboard it features a writing surface an electronic pen and the ability to read block printing
at N N pounds it may be too ambitious named but it nevertheless opens up the kind of marketing possibilities that make analysts fr
palm are n far behind
atari corp ' portfolio introduced in europe two months ago and in the u in early september weighs less than a pound costs a mere N and runs on three <unk> batteries yet has the power to run some spreads and word processing programs
some critics however say its ability to run commonplace programs is restricted by a limited memory
po computer corp meanwhile has introduced a much more sophisticated palm that can run lotus N and other sophisticated software programs but costs five times as much
at stake is what mike sw com ' president of north america operations calls the holy gr of the computer industry the search for a real computer in a package so small you can take it everywhere
the market is so new nobody knows yet how big it can be
i ' had a lot of people trying to sell me services to find out how big it is says tom hum director of marketing for grid
whether it ' N billion or N billion it does n matter
it ' huge
consider the growth of portable which now comprise N % of all personal computer sales
laptop generally anything under N pounds have become the fastest personal computer segment with sales doubling this year
responding to that demand however has led to a variety of compromise
making computers smaller often means sac memory
it also has pre use of the faster more powerful micro found in increasing numbers of desktop machines
size and weight considerations also have limited screen displays
the competitive s can get pretty petty at times
a po spokesman for example critic the atari portfolio because it requires three batteries while the po needs only two
both palm are dismissed by notebook makers who argue that they ' too small a problem po also encountered in focus groups admits gerry pu director of marketing
po trying to avoid the ga label responded with the tag line the po pc a very big computer
despite the s few question the in of the move to small machines that do n make compromise
toward that end experts say the real battle will take place between center players like to zenith and now com
com ' new machines are considered a direct threat to start firms like d inc which introduced in june a computer that like com ' uses an intel N micro and has a hard disk drive
but the d product is twice as heavy and costs more than com '
com ' announcement also spells trouble for zenith which last year had N % of the u laptop market but recently agreed to sell its computer business to ci des machines bull the french government computer maker
zenith holders will vote in december on the proposed N million sale a price that could slip because it is peg to zenith ' share and sales
com is already taking aim at zenith ' market share
rod can com ' president and chief executive officer notes pointedly that zenith ' N mini uses an unconventional two floppy disk whereas com ' new machines use the more common N N disk
john p frank president of zenith data systems simply <unk> off such criticism noting that N N <unk> were also unconventional when they first replaced five disks
we do n look at it as not being a standard we look at it as a new standard he argues
analysts do n see it that way
i ca n imagine that you ' talk to anyone who wo n tell you this is <unk> for com and a stop for everyone else says gene tal president of professional marketing management inc
adds bill le senior industry analyst for data a high market research firm we basically think that these are very hot products
the problem com is going to have is that they wo n be able to make enough of them
com ' machines include the N N floppy disk drive a back screen that is only N thick and an internal expansion slot for a mode in other words almost all the capabilities of a typical office machine
others undoubtedly will follow but most analysts believe com has at least a six lead on the competition
to ' line of portable for example features the N which is in the same weight class but is much slower and has less memory and the N which also uses a N micro but which weighs almost twice as much and is three times the size
a third model marketed in japan may hit the u by the end of the first quarter of N but by then analysts say com will have established itself as one of three major players
what about big blue

investors who bought stock with borrowed money that is on margin may be more worried than most following friday ' market drop
that ' because their broker can require them to sell some shares or put up more cash to enhance the collateral backing their loans
in october N these margin calls were thought to have contributed to the downward spiral of the stock market
typically a margin call occurs when the price of a stock falls below N % of its original value
if the investor does n put up the extra cash to satisfy the call the broker firm may begin liquid the securities
but some big broker firms said they do n expect major problems as a result of margin calls
margin calls since friday have been higher than usual but reasonable a spokesman for shear lehman hutton inc said
merrill lynch & co officials do n expect margin calls to be as big a factor as in N because fewer individual investors are buying stock on margin a spokesman said

the garden city n car company said it wo n renew contracts with nwa inc ' northwest airlines unit pan am corp ' pan american world airways unit and midway airlines at the end of this year
but it remains involved in programs with am corp ' american airlines unit and delta air lines
industry estimates put av ' annual cost of all five programs at between N million and N million
a spokesman for av would n specify the costs but said the three airlines being dropped account for far less than half of the total
budget rent a car corp of chicago and national car rental systems inc of minneapolis both said they had no plans to follow suit
in fact budget indicated it saw some benefit to staying involved in these programs in which rent earn frequent miles and fl can get car discount
i can not see how this news by her and av can not benefit budget ' programs said bob wilson budget ' vice president marketing planning
northwest and midway are two of the five airlines with which budget has agreements
national also <unk> in the northwest frequent program along with four other airlines including delta and usa group inc ' usa unit
a month ago her of park ridge n said that it would drop its marketing agreements at year end with delta america west and texas air corp ' continental airlines and eastern airlines and that pact with american airlines ua inc ' united airlines and usa also would be ended sometime after dec N
at the time her said its annual fees to those airlines amounted to N million and that the value of red awards topped N million
analysts and competitors however doubt the numbers were that high
budget said its frequent costs are substantially below av ' level
robert d card av vice president of marketing said the proliferation and costs attached to frequent programs have significantly diminished their value
this year has been difficult for both her and av said charles finn car industry analyst at alex brown & sons

tandem computers inc preparing to fight with international business machines corp for a piece of the main business said it expects to post higher revenue and earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter ended sept N
tandem said it expects to report revenue of about N million and earnings of N cents to N cents a share
the results which are in line with analysts ' estimates reflect a continued improvement in our u business said james <unk> tandem ' chief executive officer
in the year period tandem reported net income of N million or N cents a share on revenue of N million
tandem expects to report the full results for the quarter next week
analysts have predicted that the cup cal company will report revenue of N million to N million and earnings of N cents to N cents a share
commenting on the results for the quarter mr <unk> said the strength of the company ' domestic business came as a surprise to him noting that sales in every region of the u exceeded our plan
the company ' u performance was helped by a record quarter for new customers he said
tandem makes fault computers machines with built backup systems that run stock exchanges networks of automatic teller and other complex computer systems
tomorrow the company is scheduled to announce its most powerful computer ever which for the first time will bring it into direct competition with makers of main computers
tandem ' new high computer is called <unk>
prices for the machine which can come in various <unk> are N million to N million
analysts expect the new computer to wr a he slice of business away from ibm the longtime leader in main
we believe they could sip perhaps two to three billion dollars from ibm over the next few years said george weiss an analyst at the ga group
that will spur tandem ' growth
i ' be disappointed if the company grew by less than N % next year said john levin an analyst at goldman sachs & co
ibm is expected to respond to tandem ' <unk> by discount its own main which analysts say are roughly three times the price of a comparable system from tandem
obviously ibm can give bigger discount to users immediately said mr weiss
but mr <unk> questions whether that will be enough to stop tandem ' first main from taking on some of the functions that large organizations previously sought from big blue ' machines
the answer is n price reductions but new systems he said
nevertheless tandem faces a variety of challenges the biggest being that customers generally view the company ' computers as complementary to ibm ' main
even mr <unk> is reluctant to abandon this notion insisting that tandem ' new machines are n replacements for ibm ' main
we ' after a little bigger niche he said

the stock market ' sw may turn out to be good news for the economy
in one wild hour of trading the market managed to accomplish what the bush administration has been trying to do unsuccessfully for weeks
it is forcing the federal reserve to ease its grip on credit and it took the wind out of a previously ir dollar
the resulting decline in interest rates and the value of the dollar could rein american business indeed the entire economy
this may sound <unk> optimistic
after all until a few years ago the stock market was viewed as a bar of the national economy
when it went down by all tradition the economy followed
that has changed partly because the two years following the worst stock plunge in history have been reasonably comfortable
the N crash was a false alarm however you view it says university of chicago economist victor za
the market seems increasingly <unk> from the rest of the nation
its spa ca n be traced to fundamental business conditions nor do they appear to pre major shifts in the economy
the market today has a life of its own john ak chairman of international business machines corp said saturday
there ' nothing rational about this kind of action
of course the health of the economy will be threatened if the market continues to dive this week
sharply falling stock prices do reduce consumer wealth damage business confidence and discourage the foreign investors upon whom the u now relies for financial su
the financial industry was battered by the N crash
what ' more although the stock market is far less over today than two years ago the u economy is weaker
growth is slower
profits are softer
debt burden are heavier
but if the stock market does n continue to plum the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate
the fed which until friday had been resisting moves to ease credit is now poised to pour money into the economy if needed to <unk> the markets
fed officials may protest that this does n necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest policies
but the experience of the N crash suggests the fed is likely to bring down short interest rates in its effort to calm markets
anticipating the fed ' move money traders lowered a key interest rate known as the federal funds rate to N % late friday down from N % the day before
tiny movements in the rate which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans are usually among the few visible tracks that the fed leaves on the monetary markets
the dollar also began to decline friday as the stock market ' plunge caused some investors to re their desire to invest in the u
treasury officials have been arguing for months that the dollar ' strength was out of w with economic fundamental threatening to ex the export boom that has sustained manufacturers for several years
the market drop has now apparently convinced foreign investors that the treasury was right about the over dollar
a modest drop in the dollar only a modest one mind you would be welcomed by the u
that was n the case in N when the dollar was so weak that some economists and government officials seriously worried that it might collapse producing panic among foreign investors and dim the flow of foreign capital to the u
another big difference between N and N is n so comforting
in the third quarter of N the economy spur at an inflation annual rate of N %
the consensus among economists is that it grew a much more slug N % in the third quarter of N which ended two weeks ago
the plunge in stock prices is happening at a time when the economy has already slowed down says economist lawrence chi of we group a <unk> cy pa forecast company
a lot of pen demand is gone
consumer spending did drop in the months following black monday N but only slightly and for a short period of time recalls mr za a longtime student of business cycles
that was offset by strength elsewhere
the effects were much less severe and less prolonged than some had feared or expected
today he fr exports and business investment spending may be insufficient to pick up the slack if stock prices sink this week and if consumers re in reaction
what ' more the corporate borrowing bing has n aba in the past two years
we ' had two more years of significant accumulation of debt just at the time when earnings are being squeezed mr chi notes
the more a company relies on borrowed money the greater its sensitivity to an economic slow
a company with a strong balance sheet can withstand an una storm a highly leverage company may end up in bankruptcy court
the fed of course knows that very well hence its readiness to pump credit into the economy this morning
but in the process the fed risks reign inflation
even before friday ' events harvard university economist benjamin friedman was arguing that the fed wo n be able to live up to its tough words on eliminating inflation because of its responsibility to protect fragile financial markets banks and highly leverage corporations
the biggest threat on the economic horizon right now is n recession he reasons it ' an outbreak of un inflation
in the end the N collapse suggested the economy does n move in locks with stock prices
the economy does however depend on the confidence of businesses consumers and foreign investors
a panic on wall street does n exactly inspire confidence
surveys suggested that consumer confidence was high before friday
a N drop is n likely to make much of a dent multi that a few times over though and it will
if the reactions of executives gathered saturday at hot springs va for the business council meetings are typical business leaders were n overly rattled by friday ' decline
and if foreign investors become a tad more cautious well the dollar ' recent strength suggests that the u can stand it
on the bottom line the most comforting fact for the economic outlook is that we ' been through this before
two years ago about the only point of comparison was the N crash and the subsequent depression
the doom had a rec audience
the prosperity that followed black monday permits a more optimistic view today
at the very least the establishment here is taking comfort from the nation ' success in handling the last go
as sen lloyd bent d texas observed yesterday the fed avoided a melt last time
they are more sophisticated this time
